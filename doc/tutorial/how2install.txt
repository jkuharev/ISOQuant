# About installation guide
This document describes how to install ISOQuant and related software.
Installation procedure may vary depending on your operating system environment.
This document only handles generic cases for Windows, Linux and Mac OSX
machines.

# Software requirements

#. Java Virtual Machine (version 1.6 and newer or compatible)
	locally installed as the execution environment 
	as ISOQuant is a Java application.
#. MySQL Server (version 5.1. and newer or compatible)
	locally installed or available on local network.
#. Waters ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) (version 2.3. or newer)\
	in fact, you don't need PLGS itself,
	however ISOQuant needs PLGS root folder to be locally available
	(as a local folder or as a locally mounted network path)
#. Web browser (Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc.)
	for viewing generated HTML reports
#. Spreadsheet viewer (MS-Excel or compatible, e.g. LibreOffice Calc)
	for viewing generated XLS and CSV reports

# Installation steps

## Windows
To simplify the installation process on Windows machines, 
we have created a Windows installation package - ``ISOQuant for Windows``.
Packaged installation assistant will guide you through the installation process.

## Mac OS X
To simplify the installation process on Macintosh machines, 
we have created a Mac OS X image file.
The image file ``ISOQuant for Mac`` contains the ISOQuant.app, 
which should be copied to a local folder, e.g. `Applications` folder.

## Linux, Unix and other OS
For advanced users, we have created a portable distribution package 
``ISOQuant portable``, which may be used on any operating systems.
The portable distribution is an archive containing all needed files.
Use packaged launcher scripts `isoquant4unix.sh` or `isoquant4win.bat`
to launch ISOQuant application.
