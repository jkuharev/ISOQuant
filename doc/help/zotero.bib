	abstract = {An ion cyclotron resonance ({ICR}) absorption spectrum has been obtained by exciting an {ICR} spectral segment with a fixed-frequency electric field pulse, followed by broad-band detection, digitization of the (time-domain) transient response, and digital Fourier transformation to produce the (frequency-domain) absorption spectrum. For a given signal-to-noise ratio and resolution, the {FT}-{ICR} method generates a spectrum in a time which is two orders of magnitude shorter than that required in conventional slow-sweep {ICR} detection. In the present example, a signal-to-noise ratio of 8:1 and a mass resolution of about 0.005 amu for {CH}4+ (from {CH}4 at a pressure of 8 X 10-7 torr) have been achieved, using a single data acquisition period of 25.6 msec.},

No extra chemistry is necessary to distinguish N- and C-terminal fragments in the mass spectra, as this is determined from the electron capture dissociation data. With parts-per-million mass accuracy (now available by using higher field Fourier transform {MS} instruments), the complete sequences of ubiquitin (8.6 {kDa}) and melittin (2.8 {kDa}) were predicted correctly by the program. The data available also provided 91\% of the cytochrome c (12.4 {kDa}) sequence (essentially complete except for the tandem {MS}-resistant region K13{\textendash}V20 that contains the cyclic heme). Uncorrected mass values from a 6-T instrument still gave 86\% of the sequence for ubiquitin, except for distinguishing Gln/Lys.

	abstract = {Mitochondria, through oxidative phosphorylation, are the primary source of energy production in all tissues under aerobic conditions. Although critical to life, energy production is not the only function of mitochondria, and the composition of this organelle is tailored to meet the specific needs of each cell type. As an organelle, the mitochondrion has been a popular subject for proteomic analysis, but quantitative proteomic methods have yet to be applied to tease apart subtle differences among mitochondria from different tissues or muscle types. Here we used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to analyze mitochondrial proteins extracted from rat skeletal muscle, heart, and liver tissues. Based on 689 proteins identified with high confidence, mitochondria from the different tissues are qualitatively quite similar. However, striking differences emerged from the quantitative comparison of protein abundance between the tissues. Furthermore we applied similar methods to analyze mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space proteins extracted from the same mitochondrial source, providing evidence for the submitochondrial localization of a number of proteins in skeletal muscle and liver. Several proteins not previously thought to reside in mitochondria were identified, and their presence in this organelle was confirmed by protein correlation profiling. Hierarchical clustering of microarray expression data provided further evidence that some of the novel mitochondrial candidates identified in the proteomic survey might be associated with mitochondria. These data reveal several important distinctions between mitochondrial and submitochondrial proteomes from skeletal muscle, heart, and liver tissue sources. Indeed approximately one-third of the proteins identified in the soluble fractions are associated predominantly to one of the three tissues, indicating a tissue-dependent regulation of mitochondrial proteins. Furthermore a small percentage of the mitochondrial proteome is unique to each tissue.},

In the label-free differential {LC}{\textendash}{MS} approach computational methods are required for an accurate alignment of peaks extrapolated from the experimental raw data accounting for retention time and m/z signals intensity, which are strongly affected by sample matrix and instrumental performance. A novel procedure {\textquotedblleft}{MassUntangler}{\textquotedblright} for pairwise alignment has been developed, relying on a pattern-based matching algorithm integrated with filtering algorithms in a multi-step approach. The procedure has been optimized employing a two-step approach. Firstly, low-complexity {LC}{\textendash}{MS} data derived from the enzymatic digestion of two standard proteins have been analyzed. Then, the algorithm's performance has been evaluated by comparing the results with other achieved using state-of-the-art alignment tools. In the second step, our algorithm has been used for the alignment of high-complexity {LC}{\textendash}{MS} data consisting of peptides obtained by an Escherichia coli lysate available from a public repository previously used for the comparison of other alignment tools. {MassUntangler} gave excellent results in terms of precision scores (from 80\% to 93\%) and recall scores (from 68\% to 89\%), showing performances similar and even better than the previous developed tools. Considering the mass spectrometry sensitivity and accuracy, this approach allows the identification and quantification of peptides present in a biological sample at femtomole level with high confidence. The procedure's capability of aligning {LC}{\textendash}{MS} data previously corrected for distortion in retention time has been studied through a hybrid approach, in which {MassUntangler} was interfaced with the {OpenMS} {TOPP} tool {MapAligner}. The hybrid aligner yielded better results, showing that an integration of different bioinformatic approaches for accurate label-free {LC}{\textendash}{MS} data alignment should be used.},

In this study, we demonstrate that {KitW}-sh causes aberrant extramedullary myelopoiesis characterized by the expansion of immature lineage-negative cells, common myeloid progenitors, and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors in the spleen. A consistent feature shared by these cell types is the reduced expression of c-Kit. Populations expressing intermediate and high levels of Ly6G, a component of the myeloid differentiation Ag Gr-1, are also highly expanded in the spleen of sash mice. These cells are able to suppress T cell responses in vitro and phenotypically and functionally resemble myeloid-derived suppressor cells ({MDSC}). {MDSC} typically accumulate in tumor-bearing hosts and are able to dampen immune responses. Consequently, transfer of {MDSC} from naive sash mice into line 1 alveolar cell carcinoma tumor-bearing wild-type littermates leads to enhanced tumor progression. However, although it can also be observed in sash mice, accelerated growth of transplanted line 1 alveolar cell carcinoma tumors is a mast cell{\textendash}independent phenomenon. Thus, the {KitW}-sh mutation broadly affects key steps in myelopoiesis that may have an impact on mast cell research.},

	abstract = {Correlation optimized warping ({COW}) based on the total ion current ({TIC}) is a widely used time alignment algorithm ({COW}-{TIC}). This approach works successfully on chromatograms containing few compounds and having a well-defined {TIC}. In this paper, we have combined {COW} with a component detection algorithm ({CODA}) to align {LC}?{MS} chromatograms containing thousands of biological compounds with overlapping chromatographic peaks, a situation where {COW}-{TIC} often fails. {CODA} is a variable selection procedure that selects mass chromatograms with low noise and low background (so-called ?high-quality? mass chromatograms). High-quality mass chromatograms selected in each {COW} segment ensure that the same compounds (based on their mass and their retention time) are used in the two-dimensional benefit function of {COW} to obtain correct and optimal alignments ({COW}-{CODA}). The performance of the {COW}-{CODA} algorithm was evaluated on three types of complex data sets obtained from the {LC}?{MS} analysis of samples commonly used for biomarker discovery and compared to {COW}-{TIC} using a new global comparison method based on overlapping peak area: trypsin-digested serum obtained from cervical cancer patients, trypsin-digested serum from a single patient that was treated with varying preanalytical parameters (factorial design study), and urine from pregnant and nonpregnant women. While {COW}-{CODA} did result in minor misalignments in rare cases, it was clearly superior to the {COW}-{TIC} algorithm, especially when applied to highly variable chromatograms (factorial design, urine). The presented algorithm thus enables automatic time alignment and accurate peak matching of multiple {LC}?{MS} data sets obtained from complex body fluids that are often used for biomarker discovery.},

	abstract = {During the last decade new ionization techniques have made it possible to measure the molecular weight of many intact proteins by mass spectrometry, and they have made it much easier to obtain a mass spectrometric peptide map of a protein. At the same time advances in protein and {DNA} sequencing technology are resulting in an exponential increase in the number of sequences deposited in databases. Here we investigate the possibility to use mass spectrometric data to identify proteins in databases. Searching a database by total molecular weight is found to be an easy and sometimes sufficient approach. For more specificity and for error tolerance in both the mass spectrometric data and the database information we search by partial mass spectrometric peptide map of the protein. In general, just four to six proteolytic peptides measured with a mass accuracy between 0.1 and 0.01\% allow a useful search of databases such as the Protein Identification Resource ({PIR}). As the size of {DNA} and protein sequence databases grows, protein identification by partial mass spectrometric peptide maps should become increasingly powerful and may become a general method to identify and characterize proteins.},

	abstract = {With the completion of the Haemophilus influenzae Rd genomic sequence, we know the identity of most of the theoretical proteins in the proteome of this bacterium. However, the most abundant components of the actual proteome are unknown. Using mass spectrometry and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-{DE}), we sequenced and analyzed the most abundant proteins observed in the {ATCC} reference strain of H. influenzae, {NCTC} 8143 (303 of approximately 400 Coomassie-stained 2-{DE} spots). To automate the identification of 2-{DE} spots, we coupled a liquid autosampler to a microcolumn liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer capable of identifying 22 spots per day. From the 303 sequenced spots, we identified 263 unique proteins. Most of the abundant proteins lie in an isoelectric point range of {pH} 4-7 and a molecular mass range of 10-100 {kDa}. Of the observed proteins, the most abundant is the outer membrane protein P2. Based on variety and abundance, proteins involved in energy metabolism and macromolecular synthesis are the dominant classes of proteins. Unexpectedly, tryptophanase was identified as a highly abundant protein in the strain {NCTC} 8143 whose sequence is not present in the genome of the Rd strain. By searching the tandem mass spectra against the translated genomic sequence, we identified several proteins which were not annotated in the genomic sequence. Surprisingly, 22\% of the identified 2-{DE} spots represent isoforms in which gene products with the same primary sequence have different observed {pI} and M(r), indicating that these proteins are post-translationally processed. Although most proteins' predicted and observed isoelectric points and molecular masses show reasonable concordance, the observed values for several proteins deviate significantly from the predicted values. These anomalies may represent either highly processed proteins or misinterpretations of the genomic sequence. Using the technology developed in this project, the protein expression of other strains of H. influenzae grown under different environmental conditions can be compared to identify differences in their proteomes.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Early cancer detection has always been a major research focus in solid tumor oncology. Early tumor detection can theoretically result in lower stage tumors, more treatable diseases and ultimately higher cure rates with less treatment-related morbidities. Protein mass spectrometry is a potentially powerful tool for early cancer detection.
We propose a novel method for sample classification from protein mass spectrometry data. When applied to spectra from both diseased and healthy patients, the {\textquoteleft}peak probability contrast{\textquoteright} technique provides a list of all common peaks among the spectra, their statistical significance and their relative importance in discriminating between the two groups. We illustrate the method on matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization mass spectrometry data from a study of ovarian cancers.
Results: Compared to other statistical approaches for class prediction, the peak probability contrast method performs as well or better than several methods that require the full spectra, rather than just labelled peaks. It is also much more interpretable biologically. The peak probability contrast method is a potentially useful tool for sample classification from protein mass spectrometry data.

Untargeted label-free quantification, based either on feature intensities or on spectral counting, is a method that scales particularly well with respect to the number of samples. It is thus an excellent alternative to labeling techniques. In order to profit from this scalability, however, data analysis has to cope with large amounts of data, process them automatically, and do a thorough statistical analysis in order to achieve reliable results. We review the state of the art with respect to computational tools for label-free quantification in untargeted proteomics. The two fundamental approaches are feature-based quantification, relying on the summed-up mass spectrometric intensity of peptides, and spectral counting, which relies on the number of {MS}/{MS} spectra acquired for a certain protein. We review the current algorithmic approaches underlying some widely used software packages and briefly discuss the statistical strategies for analyzing the data.},

In a linear ion trap, ions are confined radially by a two-dimensional (2D) radio frequency ({RF}) field, and axially by stopping potentials applied to end electrodes. This review focuses on linear ion trap instrumentation. Potentials and ion motion in linear multipole fields and methods of ion trapping, cooling, excitation, and isolation are described. This is followed by a description of various mass discrimination effects that have been reported with linear ion traps. Linear ion traps combined in various ways with three-dimensional (3D) traps, time-of-flight ({TOF}) mass analyzers, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers are then given. Linear ion traps can be used as stand alone mass analyzers, and their use for mass analysis by Fourier transforming image currents, by mass selective radial ejection, and by mass selective axial ejection are reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev},

	abstract = {To accurately determine the quantitative change of peptides and proteins in complex proteomics samples requires knowledge of how well each ion has been measured. The precision of each ions' calculated area is predicated on how uniquely it occupies its own space in m/z and elution time. Given an initial assumption that prior to the addition of the "heavy" label, all other ion detections are unique, which is arguably untrue, an initial attempt at quantifying the pervasiveness of ion interference events in a representative binary {SILAC} experiment was made by comparing the centered m/z and retention time of the ion detections from the "light" variant to its "heavy" companion. Ion interference rates were determined for {LC}-{MS} data acquired at mass resolving powers of 20 and 40 K with and without ion mobility separation activated. An ion interference event was recorded, if present in the companion dataset was an ion within {\textpm} its $\Delta$ mass at half-height, {\textpm}15 s of its apex retention time and if utilized by {\textpm}1 drift bin. Data are presented illustrating a definitive decrease in the frequency of ion interference events with each additional increase in selectivity of the analytical workflow. Regardless of whether the quantitative experiment is a composite of labeled samples or label free, how well each ion is measured can be determined given knowledge of the instruments mass resolving power across the entire m/z scale and the ion detection algorithm reporting both the centered m/z and $\Delta$ mass at half-height for each detected ion. Given these measurements, an effective resolution can be calculated and compared with the expected instrument performance value providing a purity score for the calculated ions' area based on mass resolution. Similarly, chromatographic and drift purity scores can be calculated. In these instances, the error associated to an ions' calculated peak area is estimated by examining the variation in each measured width to that of their respective experimental median. Detail will be disclosed as to how a final ion purity score was established, providing a first measure of how accurately each ions' area was determined as well as how precise the calculated quantitative change between labeled or unlabelled pairs were determined. Presented is how common ion interference events are in quantitative proteomics {LC}-{MS} experiments and how ion purity filters can be utilized to overcome and address them, providing ultimately more accurate and precise quantification results across a wider dynamic range.},

A theoretical analysis of the cytochrome c family demonstrates the ability to identify protein sequences in the {PIR} database with a high degree of accuracy using a set of six predicted tryptic peptide masses. This method was also applied to experimentally determined peptide masses for a small {GTP}-binding protein, a protein from pig uterus, the human sex steroid binding protein, and a thermostable {DNA} polymerase. The results demonstrate that a set of observed masses which is less than 50\% of the total number of predicted masses can be used to identify a protein sequence in the database. For the analysis presented in this paper, a mass matching tolerance of 1 amu is used. Under these conditions, mass maps created by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight would also be applicable. In cases where multiple matches are observed or verification of the protein identification is needed, tandem mass spectrometry sequencing can be used to establish sequence similarity.},

As with any such discipline, communication between researchers and periodic evaluation facilitate technical progress. Complications arise when, from author to author, terminology and basic experimental techniques become incongruous and easy comparisons obviated. Several reviews on the discipline have been published that treat the historical aspects and modern research. No such review has been published since 1990. This present work focuses on post-1990 literature, not repeating the vast history.

In all, 47 reference works were investigated, of which 36 are articles concerning the atomization of liquids by primarily electrical means. As a method to show the diverse range of liquids that can be electrically atomized and to illuminate the discontinuities of data within this range, 70 liquids, as presented in the atomization references, are catalogued by reported liquid properties. The nomenclature of electrical atomization spray modes suggested by Cloupeau and Prunet-Foch (J. Electrostatics 25, 165, 1990) has been continued. Three additional definitions are presented. Suggestions as to the nomenclature and unit system used, as well as the reporting of liquid properties and experimental configurations, have been made with the purpose of facilitating comparison of future experimental results.},

In particular, label-free shotgun proteomics is highly effective for the identification of peptides and subsequently obtaining a global protein profile of a sample. As a result, this approach is widely used for discovery studies. Typically, the objective of these discovery studies is to identify proteins that are affected by some condition of interest (e.g. disease, exposure). However, for complex biological samples, label-free {LC}-{MS} proteomics experiments measure peptides and do not directly yield protein quantities. Thus, protein quantification must be inferred from one or more measured peptides. In recent years, many computational approaches to relative protein quantification of label-free {LC}-{MS} data have been published. In this review, we examine the most commonly employed quantification approaches to relative protein abundance from peak intensity values, evaluate their individual merits, and discuss challenges in the use of the various computational approaches.},

After incubation in plasma or a similar biofluid, or after injection into a mouse, the first analytical step is sedimentation of the nanoparticle-protein complexes through a sucrose cushion, thereby allowing analysis of early corona formation time points.

	abstract = {The comparison between electrospray ionization ({ESI}) mass spectra from {NaCl} solutions with and without analyte obtained under ionspray and nanospray conditions reveals different mass spectral behavior of the two {ESI} techniques. This can be attributed to the different initial droplet sizes which are in the {\textmu}m range for ionspray, while in nanospray they are believed to be about one order of magnitude smaller. In the context of the widely accepted uneven-fission model, nanospray would then enter one fission generation later; in addition, a higher initial droplet surface charge density in nanospray results in early fissions without extensive evaporation and thus increase in sample and salt concentration. This rationalizes that ionspray spectra closely resemble nanospray spectra from solutions with about one order of magnitude higher salt concentrations, showing a higher tolerance of nanospray towards salt contamination. When the analyte is a peptide (in a solution containing a high molar surplus of salt), molecule ion formation effectively competes with salt cluster ion formation; when the analyte is a sugar, it is detectable beside a high salt concentration only with nanospray, indicating the supporting effect of surface activity on ion release in the case of peptides. A model is presented which explains the different mass spectral behaviour of ionspray and nanospray by suggesting different {\textquotedblleft}predominant fission pathways{\textquotedblright} depending on the size of the initial droplets.},

Here we employ long liquid chromatography runs with high resolution coupled to an instrument with fast sequencing speed to investigate how much of the proteome is directly accessible to liquid chromatography-tandem {MS} characterization without any prefractionation steps. Triplicate single-run analyses identified 2990 yeast proteins, 68\% of the total measured in a comprehensive yeast proteome. Among them, we covered the enzymes of the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway targeted in a recent multiple reaction monitoring study. In a mammalian cell line, we identified 5376 proteins in a triplicate run, including representatives of 173 out of 200 {KEGG} metabolic and signaling pathways. Remarkably, the majority of proteins could be detected in the samples at sub-femtomole amounts and many in the low attomole range, in agreement with absolute abundance estimation done in previous works (Picotti et al. Cell, 138, 795{\textendash}806, 2009). Our results imply an unexpectedly large dynamic range of the {MS} signal and sensitivity for liquid chromatography-tandem {MS} alone.

	abstract = {Proteomics is gradually complementing large shotgun qualitative studies with hypothesis-driven quantitative experiments. Targeted analyses performed on triple quadrupole instruments in selected reaction monitoring mode are characterized by a high degree of selectivity and low limit of detection; however, the concurrent analysis of multiple analytes occurs at the expense of sensitivity because of reduced dwell time and/or selectivity due to limitation to a few transitions. A new data acquisition paradigm is presented in which selected reaction monitoring is performed in two ways to simultaneously quantify and confirm the identity of the targeted peptides. A first set of primary transitions is continuously monitored during a predetermined elution time window to precisely quantify each peptide. In addition, a set of six to eight transitions is acquired in a data-dependent event, triggered when all the primary transitions exceed a preset threshold. These additional transitions are used to generate composite tandem mass spectra to formally confirm the identity of the targeted peptides. This technique was applied to analyze the tryptic digest of a yeast lysate to demonstrate the performance of the technique. We showed a limit of detection down to tens of attomoles injected and a throughput exceeding 6000 transitions in one 60-min experiment. The technique was integrated into a linear work flow, including experimental design, data acquisition, and data evaluation, enabling large scale proteomic studies.},

	abstract = {Yeast remains an important model for systems biology and for evaluating proteomics strategies. In-depth shotgun proteomics studies have reached nearly comprehensive coverage, and rapid, targeted approaches have been developed for this organism. Recently, we demonstrated that single {LC}-{MS}/{MS} analysis using long columns and gradients coupled to a linear ion trap Orbitrap instrument had an unexpectedly large dynamic range of protein identification (Thakur, S. S., Geiger, T., Chatterjee, B., Bandilla, P., Frohlich, F., Cox, J., and Mann, M. (2011) Deep and highly sensitive proteome coverage by {LC}-{MS}/{MS} without prefractionation. Mol. Cell Proteomics 10, 10.1074/mcp.M110.003699). Here we couple an ultra high pressure liquid chromatography system to a novel bench top Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive) with the goal of nearly complete, rapid, and robust analysis of the yeast proteome. Single runs of filter-aided sample preparation ({FASP})-prepared and {LysC}-digested yeast cell lysates identified an average of 3923 proteins. Combined analysis of six single runs improved these values to more than 4000 identified proteins/run, close to the total number of proteins expressed under standard conditions, with median sequence coverage of 23\%. Because of the absence of fractionation steps, only minuscule amounts of sample are required. Thus the yeast model proteome can now largely be covered within a few hours of measurement time and at high sensitivity. Median coverage of proteins in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways with at least 10 members was 88\%, and pathways not covered were not expected to be active under the conditions used. To study perturbations of the yeast proteome, we developed an external, heavy lysine-labeled {SILAC} yeast standard representing different proteome states. This spike-in standard was employed to measure the heat shock response of the yeast proteome. Bioinformatic analysis of the heat shock response revealed that translation-related functions were down-regulated prominently, including nucleolar processes. Conversely, stress-related pathways were up-regulated. The proteomic technology described here is straightforward, rapid, and robust, potentially enabling widespread use in the yeast and other biological research communities.},

	abstract = {Several quantitative mass spectrometry based technologies have recently evolved to interrogate the complexity, interconnectivity and dynamic nature of proteomes. Currently, the most popular methods use either metabolic or chemical isotope labeling with {MS} based quantification or chemical labeling using isobaric tags with {MS}/{MS} based quantification. Here, we assess the performance of three of the most popular approaches through systematic independent large scale quantitative proteomics experiments, comparing {SILAC}, dimethyl and {TMT} labeling strategies. Although all three methods have their strengths and weaknesses, our data indicate that all three can reach a similar depth in number of identified proteins using a classical ({MS}2 based) shotgun approach. {TMT} quantification using only {MS}2 is heavily affected by co-isolation leading to compromised precision and accuracy. This issue may be partly resolved by using an {MS}3 based acquisition; however, at the cost of a significant reduction in number of proteins quantified. Interestingly, {SILAC} and chemical labeling with {MS} based quantification produce almost indistinguishable results, independent of which database search algorithm used.

Recently, we demonstrated the superior performance of a data-independent method we termed precursor acquisition independent from ion count ({PAcIFIC}). Here, we report a faster, accurate, multiplexed, and quantitative {PAcIFIC} method. Our results show that the time needed to perform such analysis can be decreased by 33\% to 66\% using modern ion trap instruments and that high mass accuracy can be applied to such a strategy. Quantification capability is demonstrated on protein standards and a whole bacterial cell lysate using isobaric tagging. Finally, we confirm in yeast the dynamic range capabilities of such a method where proteins down to less than 50 copies per cell can be monitored without sample prefractionation.},

	abstract = {Quantitative proteomics approaches using stable isotopes are well-known and used in many labs nowadays. More recently, high resolution quantitative approaches are reported that rely on {LC}-{MS} quantitation of peptide concentrations by comparing peak intensities between multiple runs obtained by continuous detection in {MS} mode. Characteristic of these comparative {LC}-{MS} procedures is that they do not rely on the use of stable isotopes; therefore the procedure is often referred to as label-free {LC}-{MS}. In order to compare at comprehensive scale peak intensity data in multiple {LC}-{MS} datasets, dedicated software is required for detection, matching and alignment of peaks. The high accuracy in quantitative determination of peptide abundancies provides an impressive level of detail. This approach also requires an experimental set-up where quantitative aspects of protein extraction and reproducible separation conditions need to be well controlled. In this paper we will provide insight in the critical parameters that affect the quality of the results and list an overview of the most recent software packages that are available for this procedure.},

	abstract = {Peripheral nerve myelin facilitates rapid impulse conduction and normal motor and sensory functions. Many aspects of myelin biogenesis, glia{\textendash}axonal interactions, and nerve homeostasis are poorly understood at the molecular level. We therefore hypothesized that only a fraction of all relevant myelin proteins has been identified so far. Combining gel-based and gel-free proteomic approaches, we identified 545 proteins in purified mouse sciatic nerve myelin, including 36 previously known myelin constituents. By mass spectrometric quantification, the predominant P0, periaxin, and myelin basic protein constitute 21, 16, and 8\% of the total myelin protein, respectively, suggesting that their relative abundance was previously misestimated due to technical limitations regarding protein separation and visualization. Focusing on tetraspan-transmembrane proteins, we validated novel myelin constituents using immuno-based methods. Bioinformatic comparison with {mRNA}-abundance profiles allowed the categorization in functional groups coregulated during myelin biogenesis and maturation. By differential myelin proteome analysis, we found that the abundance of septin 9, the protein affected in hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy, is strongly increased in a novel mouse model of demyelinating neuropathy caused by the loss of prion protein. Finally, the systematic comparison of our compendium with the positions of human disease loci allowed us to identify several candidate genes for hereditary demyelinating neuropathies. These results illustrate how the integration of unbiased proteome, transcriptome, and genome data can contribute to a molecular dissection of the biogenesis, cell biology, metabolism, and pathology of myelin.},

Here we investigate how many peptides are detectable by high resolution {MS} in standard {LC} runs of cell lysate and how many of them are accessible to data-dependent {MS}/{MS}. Isotope clusters were determined by {MaxQuant} and stringently filtered for charge states and retention times typical of peptides. This resulted in more than 100?000 likely peptide features, of which only about 16\% had been targeted for {MS}/{MS}. Three instrumental attributes determine the proportion of additional peptides that can be identified: sequencing speed, sensitivity, and precursor ion isolation. In our data, an {MS}/{MS} scan rate of 25/s would be necessary to target all peptide features, but this drops to less than 17/s for reasonably abundant peptides. Sensitivity is a greater challenge, with many peptide features requiring long {MS}/{MS} injection times ({\textgreater}250 ms). The greatest limitation, however, is the generally low proportion of the target peptide ion intensity in the {MS}/{MS} selection window (the ?precursor ion fraction? or {PIF}). Median {PIF} is only 0.14, making the peptides difficult to identify by standard {MS}/{MS} methods. Our results aid in developing strategies to further increase coverage in shotgun proteomics.},

Here, we present a workflow for the characterization of {RALY}?s interaction partners, termed {iBioPQ}, that involves in vivo biotinylation of biotin acceptor peptide ({BAP})-fused protein in the presence of the prokaryotic biotin holoenzyme synthetase of {BirA} so that it can be purified using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, circumventing the need for specific antibodies and providing efficient pulldowns. Protein eluates were subjected to tryptic digestion and identified using data-independent acquisition on an ion-mobility enabled high-resolution {nanoUPLC}-{QTOF} system. Using label-free quantification, we identified 143 proteins displaying at least 2-fold difference in pulldown compared to controls. Gene Ontology overrepresentation analysis revealed an enrichment of proteins involved in {mRNA} metabolism and translational control. Among the most abundant interacting proteins, we confirmed {RNA}-dependent interactions of {RALY} with {MATR}3, {PABP}1 and {ELAVL}1. Comparative analysis of pulldowns after {RNase} treatment revealed a protein?protein interaction of {RALY} with {eIF}4AIII, {FMRP}, and {hnRNP}-C. Our data show that {RALY}-containing {RNPs} are much more heterogeneous than previously hypothesized.},

Next, we correlated the relative abundance of identified proteins in the corona with enhanced or decreased cellular uptake of nanoparticles into human cancer and bone marrow stem cells to identify key candidates. Finally, we verified these candidate proteins by artificially decorating nanoparticles with individual proteins showing that nanoparticles precoated with the apolipoproteins {ApoA}4 or {ApoC}3 significantly decreased the cellular uptake, whereas precoating with {ApoH} increased the cellular uptake.},

	abstract = {We present an algorithmic approach to align three-dimensional chromatographic surfaces of {LC}?{MS} data of complex mixture samples. The approach consists of two steps. In the first step, we prealign chromatographic profiles:? two-dimensional projections of chromatographic surfaces. This is accomplished by correlation analysis using fast Fourier transforms. In this step, a temporal offset that maximizes the overlap and dot product between two chromatographic profiles is determined. In the second step, the algorithm generates correlation matrix elements between full mass scans of the reference and sample chromatographic surfaces. The temporal offset from the first step indicates a range of the mass scans that are possibly correlated, then the correlation matrix is calculated only for these mass scans. The correlation matrix carries information on highly correlated scans, but it does not itself determine the scan or time alignment. Alignment is determined as a path in the correlation matrix that maximizes the sum of the correlation matrix elements. The computational complexity of the optimal path generation problem is reduced by the use of dynamic programming. The program produces time-aligned surfaces. The use of the temporal offset from the first step in the second step reduces the computation time for generating the correlation matrix and speeds up the process. The algorithm has been implemented in a program, {ChromAlign}, developed in C++ language for the .{NET}2 environment in {WINDOWS} {XP}. In this work, we demonstrate the applications of {ChromAlign} to alignment of {LC}?{MS} surfaces of several datasets:? a mixture of known proteins, samples from digests of surface proteins of T-cells, and samples prepared from digests of cerebrospinal fluid. {ChromAlign} accurately aligns the {LC}?{MS} surfaces we studied. In these examples, we discuss various aspects of the alignment by {ChromAlign}, such as constant time axis shifts and warping of chromatographic surfaces.},

	abstract = {This article describes a new algorithm for charge state determination and deconvolution of electrospray ionization ({ESI}) mass-to-charge ratio spectra. The algorithm (Zscore) is based on a charge scoring scheme that incorporates all above-threshold members of a family of charge states or isotopic components, and deconvolves both low- and high-resolution mass-to-charge ratio spectra, with or without a peak list (stick plot). A scoring weight factor, log (I/I 0), in which I is the signal magnitude at a calculated mass-to-charge ratio, and I 0 is the signal threshold near that mass-to-charge ratio, was used in most cases. For high-resolution mass-to-charge ratio spectra in which all isotopic peaks are resolved, the algorithm can deconvolve overlapped isotopic multiplets of the same or different charge state. Compared to other deconvolution techniques, the algorithm is robust, rapid, and fully automated (i. e., no user input during the deconvolution process). It eliminates artifact peaks without introducing peak distortions. Its performance is demonstrated for experimental {ESI} Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass-to-charge ratio spectra (both low and high resolution). Charge state deconvolution to yield a {\textquotedblleft}zero-charge{\textquotedblright} mass spectrum should prove particularly useful for interpreting spectra of complex mixtures, identifying contaminants, noncovalent adducts, fragments (N-terminal, C-terminal, internal), and chemical modifications of electrosprayed biomacromolecules.},

This was also the case for 46 proteins in a mouse whole cell lysate. For absolute quantitation, {PAI} was converted to exponentially modified {PAI} ({emPAI}), equal to 10PAI minus one, which is proportional to protein content in a protein mixture. For the 46 proteins in the whole lysate, the deviation percentages of the {emPAI}-based abundances from the actual values were within 63\% on average, similar or better than determination of abundance by protein staining. {emPAI} was applied to comprehensive protein expression analysis and to a comparison study between gene and protein expression in a human cancer cell line, {HCT}116. The values of {emPAI} are easily calculated and add important quantitation information to proteomic experiments; therefore we suggest that they should be reported in large scale proteomic identification projects.},

The first part of the review explains the electrospray ionisation process, design of mass spectrometers with separation capability, characteristics of the mass spectrum, and practical considerations in quantitative analysis. The second part then focuses on some clinical applications. The capability of {ESI}-tandem-{MS} in measuring bio-molecules sharing similar molecular structures makes it particularly useful in screening for inborn errors of amino acid, fatty acid, purine, pyrimidine metabolism and diagnosis of galactosaemia and peroxisomal disorders. Electrospray ionisation is also efficient in generating cluster ions for structural elucidation of macromolecules. This has fostered a new and improved approach (vs electrophoresis) for identification and quantification of haemoglobin variants. With the understanding of glycohaemoglobin structure, an {IFCC} reference method for glycohaemoglobin assay has been established using {ESI}-{MS}. It represents a significant advancement for the standardisation of {HbA}1c in diabetic monitoring. With its other applications such as in therapeutic drug monitoring, {ESI}-{MS} will continue to exert an important influence in the future development and organisation of the clinical laboratory service.},

This capability was brought about by delayed extraction techniques used in conjunction with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization ({MALDI}) on a reflectron time-of-flight ({TOF}) mass spectrometer. This work explores the advantage of using accurate mass measurement (and thus constraint on the possible elemental composition of components in a protein digest) in strategies for searching protein, gene, and {EST} databases that employ (a) mass values alone, (b) fragment-ion tagging derived from {MS}/{MS} spectra, and (c) de novo interpretation of {MS}/{MS} spectra. Significant improvement in the discriminating power of database searches has been found using only molecular weight values (i.e., measured mass) of {\textgreater}10 peptide masses. When {MALDI}-{TOF} instruments are able to achieve the {\textpm}0.5?5 ppm mass accuracy necessary to distinguish peptide elemental compositions, it is possible to match homologous proteins having {\textgreater}70\% sequence identity to the protein being analyzed. The combination of a {\textpm}10 ppm measured parent mass of a single tryptic peptide and the near-complete amino acid ({AA}) composition information from immonium ions generated by {MS}/{MS} is capable of tagging a peptide in a database because only a few sequence permutations {\textgreater}11 {AA}'s in length for an {AA} composition can ever be found in a proteome. De novo interpretation of peptide {MS}/{MS} spectra may be accomplished by altering our {MS}-Tag program to replace an entire database with calculation of only the sequence permutations possible from the accurate parent mass and immonium ion limited {AA} compositions. A hybrid strategy is employed using de novo {MS}/{MS} interpretation followed by text-based sequence similarity searching of a database.},

We compared the quantitative figures of merit for this method to those for existing strategies by performing an analysis of the soluble fraction of whole-cell lysates from yeast metabolically labeled in vivo with 15N. To automate this analysis, we modified software ({RelEx}) previously written in the Yates lab to generate chromatograms directly from tandem mass spectra. These chromatograms showed improvements in signal-to-noise ratio of approximately three- to fivefold over corresponding chromatograms generated from mass spectrometry scans. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of the data-independent acquisition strategy coupled with chromatogram reconstruction from tandem mass spectra, we measured protein expression levels in two developmental stages of Caenorhabditis elegans.},

	abstract = {The stability and atomization characteristics of electrohydrodynamic ({EHD}) jets have been investigated experimentally. {EHD} jets were formed by forcing propylene glycol at a steady flow rate through a charged capillary tube. The capillary tube had an outer diameter of 890 $\mu$m, the electric potential applied to the tube ranged from 0 to 20 {kV}, the liquid flow rate ranged from 100 to 500 $\mu$l min-1, and the gap between the tube and ground ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 cm. Observations of the fluid discharge from the capillary were made with a {CCD} system with a microscopic lens attachment and a synchronized strobe lamp. In general, a single jet emanating from a conical meniscus (cone-jet) was observed to be stable at applied voltages on the order of 5{\textendash}10 {kV}. The stable configuration at higher applied voltages was a ring of smaller jets emanating from the periphery of the capillary (multi-jet). Some hysteresis was observed in the stability of each configuration. The resulting droplets in the cone-jet configuration tend to be roughly 10 times smaller than the capillary, while the droplets that break off in the multi-jet mode are roughly 30 times smaller than the capillary. The implications of the stable multi-jet mode are that for a given flow rate, smaller droplets can be produced in the multi-jet mode than in the cone-jet mode.},

	abstract = {Quantitative proteomics has traditionally been performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, but recently, mass spectrometric methods based on stable isotope quantitation have shown great promise for the simultaneous and automated identification and quantitation of complex protein mixtures. Here we describe a method, termed {SILAC}, for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, for the in vivo incorporation of specific amino acids into all mammalian proteins. Mammalian cell lines are grown in media lacking a standard essential amino acid but supplemented with a non-radioactive, isotopically labeled form of that amino acid, in this case deuterated leucine (Leu-d3). We find that growth of cells maintained in these media is no different from growth in normal media as evidenced by cell morphology, doubling time, and ability to differentiate. Complete incorporation of Leu-d3 occurred after five doublings in the cell lines and proteins studied. Protein populations from experimental and control samples are mixed directly after harvesting, and mass spectrometric identification is straightforward as every leucine-containing peptide incorporates either all normal leucine or all Leu-d3. We have applied this technique to the relative quantitation of changes in protein expression during the process of muscle cell differentiation. Proteins that were found to be up-regulated during this process include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fibronectin, and pyruvate kinase M2. {SILAC} is a simple, inexpensive, and accurate procedure that can be used as a quantitative proteomic approach in any cell culture system.},

This label-free, {LCMS} acquisition method observes all detectable, eluting peptides and their corresponding fragment ions. Postacquisition data analysis methods extract both the chromatographic and the mass spectrometric information on the tryptic peptides to provide time-resolved, accurate mass measurements, which are subsequently used for quantitation and identification of constituent proteins. The response of E. coli to carbon source variation is well understood, and it is thus commonly used as a model biological system when validating an analytical method. Using this {LCMS} approach, we characterized proteins isolated from E. coli grown in glucose, lactose, and acetate. The change in relative abundance of the corresponding proteins was measured from peptides common to both conditions. Protein identities were also determined for those peptides that were unique to each condition, and these identities were found to be consistent with the underlying biochemical restrictions imposed by the growth conditions. The relative change in abundance of the characterized proteins ranged from 0.1- to 90-fold among the three binary comparisons. The overall coverage of the characterized proteins ranged from 10 to 80\%, consisting of one to 34 peptides per protein. The quantitative results obtained from our study were comparable to other existing proteomic and transcriptional profiling approaches. This study illustrates the robustness of this novel {LCMS} approach for the simultaneous quantitative and comprehensive qualitative analysis of proteins in complex mixtures.},

During {LC}/{MSE} analysis, alternating {MS} scans of ?normal? and ?elevated? collision energy are collected at regular intervals, providing nearly a 100\% duty cycle for precursor detection and fragmentation because all precursors are fragmented across their full chromatographic elution profile. This is in contrast to {DDA}-based {MS}/{MS} where serial selection of precursor ions is biased toward interrogation and detection of the highest abundance sample components by virtue of the intensity-driven interrogation scheme employed. Both modes of acquisition were applied to a simple four-protein standard mixture with a 16-fold dynamic range in concentration, an in-gel digest of the Arabidopsis thaliana protein {FLS}2 purified by immunoprecipitation, and a solution-digested tomato leaf proteome sample. Dramatic improvement for individual protein sequence coverage was obtained for all three samples analyzed by the {DIA} approach, particularly for the lowest abundance sample components. In many instances, precursors readily detected and identified during {DIA} were either interrogated by {MS}/{MS} during {DDA} at inopportune points in their chromatographic elution profiles resulting in poor quality product ion spectra or not interrogated at all. Detailed evaluation of both {DDA} and {DIA} raw data and timing of the {MS}-to-{MS}/{MS} switching events clearly revealed the fundamental limitations of serial {MS}/{MS} interrogation and the advantages of parallel fragmentation by {DIA} for more comprehensive protein identification and characterization which holds promise for enhanced isoform and post-translational modification analysis.},

	abstract = {Clustering, in data mining, is useful for discovering groups and identifying interesting distributions in the underlying data. Traditional clustering algorithms either favor clusters with spherical shapes and similar sizes, or are very fragile in the presence of outliers. We propose a new clustering algorithm called {CURE} that is more robust to outliers, and identifies clusters having non-spherical shapes and wide variances in size. {CURE} achieves this by representing each cluster by a certain fixed number of points that are generated by selecting well scattered points from the cluster and then shrinking them toward the center of the cluster by a specified fraction. Having more than one representative point per cluster allows {CURE} to adjust well to the geometry of non-spherical shapes and the shrinking helps to dampen the effects of outliers. To handle large databases, {CURE} employs a combination of random sampling and partitioning. A random sample drawn from the data set is first partitioned and each partition is partially clustered. The partial clusters are then clustered in a second pass to yield the desired clusters. Our experimental results confirm that the quality of clusters produced by {CURE} is much better than those found by existing algorithms. Furthermore, they demonstrate that random sampling and partitioning enable {CURE} to not only outperform existing algorithms but also to scale well for large databases without sacrificing clustering quality.},

Data from different samples are not synchronised, i.e., the peak from one metabolite does not appear in exactly the same place in all samples. For datasets with many samples, this problem is nontrivial, because each sample contains hundreds to thousands of peaks that shift and are identified ambiguously. Statistical analysis of the data assumes that peaks from one metabolite are found in one column of a data table. For every error in the data table, the statistical analysis loses power and the risk of missing a biomarker increases. It is therefore important to solve the correspondence problem by synchronising samples and there is no method that solves it once and for all. In this review, we analyse the correspondence problem, discuss current state-of-the-art methods for synchronising samples, and predict the properties of future methods.},

	abstract = {When a liquid meniscus held at the exit of a metallic capillary tube is charged to a high voltage V, the free surface often takes the form of a cone whose apex emits a steady microjet, and thus injects a certain charge I and liquid volume Q per unit time into the surrounding gas. This work deals with liquids with relatively large conductivities K, for which the jet diameter dj is much smaller than the diameter dn of the capillary tube. In the limit dj\&sol;dn {\textrightarrow} 0, the structure of the jet (dj and I, in particular) becomes independent of electrostatic parameters such as V or the electrode configuration, being governed mostly by the liquid properties and flow rate Q. Furthermore, the measured current is given approximately by I = f(\&epsi;) ($\gamma${QK}\&sol;\&epsi;)\&half; for a wide variety of liquids and conditions (\&epsi;, and $\gamma$ are, respectively, the dielectric constant of the liquid and the coefficient of interfacial tension; f(\&epsi;) is shown in figure 11). The following explanation is proposed for this behaviour. Convection associated with the liquid flow Q transports the net surface charge towards the cone tip. This upsets the electrostatic surface charge distribution slightly at distances r from the apex large compared to a certain charge relaxation length $\lambda$, but substantially when r \~{} $\lambda$. When the fluid motion is modelled as a sink flow, $\lambda$ is of the order of r* = (Q\&epsi;\&epsi;0\&sol;K)\${\textbackslash}frac13\$ (\&epsi;0 is the electrical permittivity of vacuum). If, in addition, the surface charge density is described through Taylor\&apos;s theory, the corresponding surface current convected towards the apex scales as Is \~{} ($\gamma${QK}\&sol;\&epsi;)\&half;, as observed for the spray current. The sink flow hypothesis is shown to be realistic for sufficiently small jet Reynolds numbers. In a few photographs of ethylene glycol cone jets, we find the rough scaling dj \~{} 0.4r* for the jet diameter, which shows that the jet forms as soon as charge relaxation effects set in. In the limit \&epsi; \&Gt; 1, an upper bound is found for the convected current at the virtual cone apex, which accounts for only one-quarter of the total measured spray current. The rest of the charge must accordingly reach the head of the jet by conduction through the bulk.},

Other attractions of the approach include the broad and relatively unbiased proteome coverage, the capability for exploiting stable isotope labeling methods to realize high precision for relative protein abundance measurements, and the projected potential for study of mammalian proteomes when combined with additional sample fractionation.

	abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) has become a prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomics and metabolomics samples. In many applications multiple {LC}-{MS} measurements need to be compared, e. g. to improve reliability or to combine results from different samples in a statistical comparative analysis. As in all physical experiments, {LC}-{MS} data are affected by uncertainties, and variability of retention time is encountered in all data sets. It is therefore necessary to estimate and correct the underlying distortions of the retention time axis to search for corresponding compounds in different samples. To this end, a variety of so-called {LC}-{MS} map alignment algorithms have been developed during the last four years. Most of these approaches are well documented, but they are usually evaluated on very specific samples only. So far, no publication has been assessing different alignment algorithms using a standard {LC}-{MS} sample along with commonly used quality criteria.

	abstract = {We examined the different steps necessary for the enzymatic digestion of proteins in the polyacrylamide matrix after gel electrophoresis. As a result, we developed an improved method for obtaining peptides for internal sequence analysis from 1-2 micrograms of in-gel-digested proteins. The long washing-lyophilization-equilibration steps necessary to eliminate the dye, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and other gel-associated contaminants that perturb protein digestion in Coomassie blue-stained gels have been replaced by washing for 40 min with 50\% acetonitrile, drying for 10 min at room temperature, and then rehydrating with a protease solution. The washing and drying steps result in a substantial reduction of the gel slice volume that, when next swollen in the protease solution, readily absorbs the enzyme, facilitating digestion. The Coomassie blue staining procedure has also been modified by reducing acetic acid and methanol concentrations in the staining solution and by eliminating acetic acid in the destaining solution. The peptides resulting from the in-gel digestion are easily recovered by passive elution, in excellent yields for structural characterization. This simple and rapid method has been successfully applied for the internal sequence analysis of membrane proteins from the rat mitochondria resolved in preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.},

Integrating traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry ({TWIMS}) enables in-line gas phase separation which when coupled with nanoflow liquid chromatography and data independent acquisition tandem mass spectrometry, confers significant advantages to the discovery of protein biomarkers by improving separation and inherent sensitivity. Incorporation of {TWIMS} leads to a packet of concentrated ions which ultimately provides a significant improvement in sensitivity. As a consequence of ion packeting, when present at high concentrations, accurate quantitation of proteins can be affected due to detector saturation effects. Human plasma was analyzed in triplicate using liquid-chromatography data independent acquisition mass spectrometry ({LC}-{DIA}-{MS}) and using liquid-chromatography ion-mobility data independent acquisition mass spectrometry ({LC}-{IM}-{DIA}-{MS}). The inclusion of {TWIMS} was assessed for the effect on sample throughput, data integrity, confidence of protein and peptide identification, and dynamic range. The number of identified proteins is significantly increased by an average of 84\% while both the precursor and product mass accuracies are maintained between the modalities. Sample dynamic range is also maintained while quantitation is achieved for all but the most abundant proteins by incorporating a novel data interpretation method that allows accurate quantitation to occur. This additional separation is all achieved within a workflow with no discernible deleterious effect on throughput. Consequently, {TWIMS} greatly enhances proteome coverage and can be reliably used for quantification when using an alternative product ion quantification strategy. Using {TWIMS} in biomarker discovery in human plasma is thus recommended.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach to the identification of mass spectrometrically fragmented peptides. A fragmentation spectrum usually contains a short, easily identifiable series of sequence ions, which yields a partial sequence. This partial sequence divides the peptide into three parts-regions 1, 2, and 3-characterized by the added mass m1 of region 1, the partial sequence of region 2, and the added mass m3 of region 3. We call the construct, m1 partial sequence m3, a "peptide sequence tag" and show that it is a highly specific identifier of the peptide. An algorithm developed here that uses the sequence tag to find the peptide in a sequence database is up to 1 million-fold more discriminating than the partial sequence information alone. Peptides can be identified even in the presence of an unknown posttranslational modification or an amino acid substitution between an entry in the sequence database and the measured peptide. These concepts are demonstrated with model and practical examples of electrospray mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides. Just two to three amino acid residues derived by fragmentation are enough to identify these peptides. In peptide mapping applications, even less information is necessary.},

As physiological systems are highly dynamic, it is important to obtain a time-resolved knowledge of protein-corona formation, development and biological relevancy. Here we show that label-free snapshot proteomics can be used to obtain quantitative time-resolved profiles of human plasma coronas formed on silica and polystyrene nanoparticles of various size and surface functionalization. Complex time- and nanoparticle-specific coronas, which comprise almost 300 different proteins, were found to form rapidly ({\textless}0.5 minutes) and, over time, to change significantly in terms of the amount of bound protein, but not in composition. Rapid corona formation is found to affect haemolysis, thrombocyte activation, nanoparticle uptake and endothelial cell death at an early exposure time.

We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be com pared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration.

	abstract = {A new denoising and peak picking algorithm ({MEND}, matched filtration with experimental noise determination) for analysis of {LC}?{MS} data is described. The algorithm minimizes both random and chemical noise in order to determine {MS} peaks corresponding to sample components. Noise characteristics in the data set are experimentally determined and used for efficient denoising. {MEND} is shown to enable low-intensity peaks to be detected, thus providing additional useful information for sample analysis. The process of denoising, performed in the chromatographic time domain, does not distort peak shapes in the m/z domain, allowing accurate determination of {MS} peak centroids, including low-intensity peaks. {MEND} has been applied to denoising of {LC}-{MALDI}-{TOF}-{MS} and {LC}-{ESI}-{TOF}-{MS} data for tryptic digests of protein mixtures. {MEND} is shown to suppress chemical and random noise and baseline fluctuations, as well as filter out false peaks originating from the matrix ({MALDI}) or mobile phase ({ESI}). In addition, {MEND} is shown to be effective for protein expression analysis by allowing selection of a large number of differentially expressed {ICAT} pairs, due to increased signal-to-noise ratio and mass accuracy.},

This technique is based on the direct comparison of multiple runs, obtained by continuous detection in {MS} mode. Only differentially expressed peptides are selected for further fragmentation, thus avoiding the bias toward abundant peptides typical of data-dependent tandem {MS}. The computational framework includes detection, alignment, normalization and matching of peaks across multiple sets, and several software packages are available to address these processing steps. Yet, more care should be taken to improve the quality of the {LC}-{MS} maps entering the pipeline, as this parameter severely affects the results of all downstream analyses. In this paper we show how the inclusion of a preprocessing step of background subtraction in a common laboratory pipeline can lead to an enhanced inclusion list of peptides selected for fragmentation and consequently to better protein identification.},

In this method the protein database is searched to identify linear amino acid sequences within a mass tolerance of {\textpm}1 u of the precursor ion molecular weight A cross-correlation function is then used to provide a measurement of similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios for the fragment ions predicted from amino acid sequences obtained from the database and the fragment ions observed in the tandem mass spectrum. In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions of the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successful match between sequence and spectrum. Searches of species-specific protein databases with tandem mass spectra acquired from peptides obtained from the enzymatically digested total proteins of E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells allowed matching of the spectra to amino acid sequences within proteins of these organisms. The approach described in this manuscript provides a convenient method to interpret tandem mass spectra with known sequences in a protein database.},

However, the peptide-centric nature of shotgun proteomics complicates the analysis and biological interpretation of the data especially in the case of higher eukaryote organisms. The same peptide sequence can be present in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms. Such shared peptides therefore can lead to ambiguities in determining the identities of sample proteins. In this article we illustrate the difficulties of interpreting shotgun proteomic data and discuss the need for common nomenclature and transparent informatic approaches. We also discuss related issues such as the state of protein sequence databases and their role in shotgun proteomic analysis, interpretation of relative peptide quantification data in the presence of multiple protein isoforms, the integration of proteomic and transcriptional data, and the development of a computational infrastructure for the integration of multiple diverse datasets.},

As a result, different methods and algorithms have been developed to perform relative or absolute quantification based on mass spectrometry data. One of the most popular quantification methods are the so-called label-free approaches, which require no special sample processing, and can even be applied retroactively to existing data sets. Of these label-free methods, the {MS}/{MS}-based approaches are most often applied, mainly because of their inherent simplicity as compared to {MS}-based methods. The main application of these approaches is the determination of relative protein amounts between different samples, expressed as protein ratios. However, as we demonstrate here, there are some issues with the reproducibility across replicates of these protein ratio sets obtained from the various {MS}/{MS}-based label-free methods, indicating that the existing methods are not optimally robust. We therefore present two new methods (called {RIBAR} and {xRIBAR}) that use the available {MS}/{MS} data more effectively, achieving increased robustness. Both the accuracy and the precision of our novel methods are analyzed and compared to the existing methods to illustrate the increased robustness of our new methods over existing ones.},

However, a comprehensive knowledge of particle-guided protein fingerprints and their dependence on nanomaterial properties is incomplete. We studied the long-lived (?hard?) blood plasma derived corona on monodispersed amorphous silica nanoparticles differing in size (20, 30, and 100 nm). Employing label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting the composition of the protein corona was analyzed not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Detected proteins were bioinformatically classified according to their physicochemical and biological properties. Binding of the 125 identified proteins did not simply reflect their relative abundance in the plasma but revealed an enrichment of specific lipoproteins as well as proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway. In contrast, immunoglobulins and acute phase response proteins displayed a lower affinity for the particles. Protein decoration of the negatively charged particles did not correlate with protein size or charge, demonstrating that electrostatic effects alone are not the major driving force regulating the nanoparticle?protein interaction. Remarkably, even differences in particle size of only 10 nm significantly determined the nanoparticle corona, although no clear correlation with particle surface volume, protein size, or charge was evident. Particle size quantitatively influenced the particle?s decoration with 37\% of all identified proteins, including (patho)biologically relevant candidates. We demonstrate the complexity of the plasma corona and its still unresolved physicochemical regulation, which need to be considered in nanobioscience in the future.},

Recently, significant progress has been made in each of these steps for both secondary ion mass spectrometry ({SIMS}) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization ({MALDI}) imaging of biological samples. Examples demonstrating localization of proteins in tumors, a reduction of lamellar phospholipids in the region binding two single celled organisms, and sub-cellular distributions of several biomolecules have all contributed to an increasing upsurge in interest in imaging mass spectrometry.

	abstract = {Negative ion electrospray ({ES}) operating on a single quadrupole mass spectrometer for the detection of low-molecular-weight molecules is discussed. The {ES} interface was operated at a positive cylindrical electrode potential to produce negative ions, and the results obtained were compared to the positive ion mode. As in the case of operation in the more common positive mode, negative ions with varying degrees of solvation and structurally relevant fragments can be obtained from a variety of solute species, including $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, aminocyclitols, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, nucleotides, peptides, and explosives. No fragmentation of parent species, except those from some labile explosives, was provided because low potential differences are applied between the capillary and the first skimmer, and electrical discharge is avoided in the gas phase. An increase in the capillary voltage resulted in collision-induced decomposition to produce structurally relevant fragment ions in both operation modes. An evaluation of representative chromatographic solvents indicated that 2-propanol added with oxygen in the {ES} bath gas is best suited to suppress electrical (corona) discharge phenomena in negative ion operation, whereas it aids in solution nebulization, desolvation, and transfer of ions in solution to the gas phase. For positive ion mode, no such precaution was necessary. Conditions that promote the formation of ions in solution usually improve {ES} response. Therefore, an increase in the solvent {pH} can increase the sensitivity in negative ion {ES} ionization. Negative ion {ES} offers the advantage of providing complementary structural information to help in the characterization of an unknown compound or to confirm a certain tentatively proposed structure. Nucleotides and explosives were best characterized in negative ion mode owing to the ease with which they form anions in solution, and they could be detected down to the 1-pg/$\mu$L level.},

To evaluate this technique, the fragmentation patterns of a mixture of ions ranging in mass, charge state and drift time were analyzed to determine their optimal fragmentation conditions. The precursor ions were pulsed into the {IMS}-{MS} instrument and separated in the {IMS} drift cell based on mobility differences. Two differentially pumped short quadrupoles were used to focus the ions exiting the drift cell, and fragmentation was induced by collision induced dissociation ({CID}) between the conductance limiting orifice behind the second short quadrupole and before the first octopole in the mass spectrometer. To explore the fragmentation spectrum of each precursor ion, the bias voltages for the short quadrupoles and conductance limiting orifices were increased from 0 V to 50 V above non-fragmentation voltage settings. An approximately linear correlation was observed between the optimal fragmentation voltage for each ion and its specific drift time, so a linear voltage gradient was employed to supply less collision energy to high mobility ions (e.g., small conformations or higher charge state ions) and more to low mobility ions. Fragmentation efficiencies were found to be similar for different ions when the fragmentation voltage was linearly ramped with drift time, but varied drastically when only a single voltage was used.},

For shotgun proteomics on complex protein mixtures, data-independent {MS}/{MS} offers certain advantages over the traditional data-dependent {MS}/{MS}: identification of low-abundance peptides with insignificant precursor peaks, more direct relative quantification, free of biases caused by competing precursors and dynamic exclusion, and faster throughput due to simultaneous fragmentation of multiple peptides. However, data-independent {MS}/{MS}, especially on low-resolution ion-trap instruments, strains standard peptide identification programs, because of less precise knowledge of the peptide precursor mass and large numbers of spectra composed of two or more peptides. Here we describe a computer program called {DeMux} that deconvolves mixture spectra and improves the peptide identification rate by ?25\%. We compare the number of identifications made by data-independent and data-dependent {MS}/{MS} at the peptide and protein levels: conventional data-dependent {MS}/{MS} makes a greater number of identifications but is less reproducible from run to run.},

It plays a key role in the functioning of the nervous system by allowing fast saltatory conduction of nerve pulses. Profiling of the proteins present in myelin is an indispensable prerequisite to better understand the molecular aspects of this dynamic, functionally active membrane. Two types of protein, the myelin basic protein and the proteolipid protein, account for nearly 85\% of the protein content in myelin. Identification and characterization of the other ?minor? proteins is, in this respect, a real challenge. In the present work, two proteomic strategies were applied in order to study the protein composition of myelin from the murine central nervous system. First, the protein mixture was separated by 2D-gel electrophoresis and, after spot excision and in-gel digestion, samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Via this approach, we identified 57 protein spots, corresponding to 38 unique proteins. Alternatively, the myelin sample was digested by trypsin and the resulting peptide mixture was further analyzed by off-line 2D-liquid chromatography. After the second-dimension separation ({nanoLC}), the peptides were spotted ?on-line? onto a {MALDI} target and analyzed by {MALDI} {TOF}-{TOF} mass spectrometry. We identified 812 peptides by {MALDI} {MS}/{MS}, representing 93 proteins. Membrane proteins, low abundant proteins, and highly basic proteins were all represented in this shotgun proteomic approach. By combining the results of both approaches, we can present a comprehensive proteomic map of myelin, comprising a total of 103 protein identifications, which is of utmost importance for the molecular understanding of white matter and its disorders.

The probability-based search engine Mascot has found widespread use as a tool to correlate tandem mass spectra with peptides in a sequence database. Although the Mascot scoring algorithm provides a probability-based model for peptide identification, the independent peptide scores do not correlate with the significance of the proteins to which they match. Herein, we describe a heuristic method for organizing proteins identified at a specified false-discovery rate using Mascot-matched peptides. We call this method {PROVALT}, and it uses peptide matches from a random database to calculate false-discovery rates for protein identifications and reduces a complex list of peptide matches to a nonredundant list of homologous protein groups. This method was evaluated using Mascot-identified peptides from a Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigote whole-cell lysate, which was separated by multidimensional {LC} and analyzed by {MS}/{MS}. {PROVALT} was then compared with the two traditional methods of protein identification when using Mascot, the single peptide score and cumulative protein score methods, and was shown to be superior to both in regards to the number of proteins identified and the inclusion of lower scoring nonrandom peptide matches.},

	abstract = {The disintegration of drops in strong electric fields is believed to play an important part in the formation of thunderstorms, at least in those parts of them where no ice crystals are present. Zeleny showed experimentally that disintegration begins as a hydrodynamical instability, but his ideas about the mechanics of the situation rest on the implicit assumption that instability occurs when the internal pressure is the same as that outside the drop. It is shown that this assumption is false and that instability of an elongated drop would not occur unless a pressure difference existed. When this error is corrected it is found that a drop, elongated by an electric field, becomes unstable when its length is 1.9 times its equatorial diameter, and the calculated critical electric field agrees with laboratory experiments to within 1\%. When the drop becomes unstable the ends develop obtuse-angled conical points from which axial jets are projected but the stability calculations give no indication of the mechanics of this process. It is shown theoretically that a conical interface between two fluids can exist in equilibrium in an electric field, but only when the cone has a semi-vertical angle 49.3\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$. Apparatus was constructed for producing the necessary field, and photographs show that conical oil/water interfaces and soap films can be produced at the caloulated voltage and that their semi-vertical angles are very close to 49.3\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$. The photographs give an indication of how the axial jets are produced but no complete analytical description of the process is attempted.},

The peptides are generated by in situ reduction, alkylation, and tryptic digestion of proteins electroblotted from two-dimensional gels. Masses are determined at the subpicomole level by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of the unfractionated digest. A computer program has been developed that searches the protein sequence database for multiple peptides of individual proteins that match the measured masses. To ensure that the most recent database updates are included, a theoretical digest of the entire database is generated each time the program is executed. This method facilitates simultaneous processing of a large number of two-dimensional gel spots. The method was applied to a two-dimensional gel of a crude Escherichia coli extract that was electroblotted onto poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. Ten randomly chosen spots were analyzed. With as few as three peptide masses, each protein was uniquely identified from over 91,000 protein sequences. All identifications were verified by concurrent N-terminal sequencing of identical spots from a second blot. One of the spots contained an N-terminally blocked protein that required enzymatic cleavage, peptide separation, and Edman degradation for confirmation of its identity.},

Many of these applications compare multiple {LC}-{MS} experiments, each of which can be represented as a 2-D image.

	abstract = {Mass accuracy is a key parameter of mass spectrometric performance. {TOF} instruments can reach low parts per million, and {FT}-{ICR} instruments are capable of even greater accuracy provided ion numbers are well controlled. Here we demonstrate sub-ppm mass accuracy on a linear ion trap coupled via a radio frequency-only storage trap (C-trap) to the orbitrap mass spectrometer ({LTQ} Orbitrap). Prior to acquisition of a spectrum, a background ion originating from ambient air is first transferred to the C-trap. Ions forming the {MS} or {MSn} spectrum are then added to this species, and all ions are injected into the orbitrap for analysis. Real time recalibration on the {\textquotedblleft}lock mass{\textquotedblright} by corrections of mass shift removes mass error associated with calibration of the mass scale. The remaining mass error is mainly due to imperfect peaks caused by weak signals and is addressed by averaging the mass measurement over the {LC} peak, weighted by signal intensity. For peptide database searches in proteomics, we introduce a variable mass tolerance and achieve average absolute mass deviations of 0.48 ppm (standard deviation 0.38 ppm) and maximal deviations of less than 2 ppm. For tandem mass spectra we demonstrate similarly high mass accuracy and discuss its impact on database searching. High and routine mass accuracy in a compact instrument will dramatically improve certainty of peptide and small molecule identification.},

	abstract = {The orbitrap mass analyzer combines high sensitivity, high resolution, and high mass accuracy in a compact format. In proteomics applications, it is used in a hybrid configuration with a linear ion trap ({LTQ}-Orbitrap) where the linear trap quadrupole ({LTQ}) accumulates, isolates, and fragments peptide ions. Alternatively, isolated ions can be fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation. A recently introduced stand-alone orbitrap analyzer (Exactive) also features a higher energy collisional dissociation cell but cannot isolate ions. Here we report that this instrument can efficiently characterize protein mixtures by alternating {MS} and {\textquotedblleft}all-ion fragmentation{\textquotedblright} ({AIF}) {MS}/{MS} scans in a manner similar to that previously described for quadrupole time-of-flight instruments. We applied the peak recognition algorithms of the {MaxQuant} software at both the precursor and product ion levels. Assignment of fragment ions to co-eluting precursor ions was facilitated by high resolution (100,000 at m/z 200) and high mass accuracy. For efficient fragmentation of different mass precursors, we implemented a stepped collision energy procedure with cumulative {MS} readout. {AIF} on the Exactive identified 45 of 48 proteins in an equimolar protein standard mixture and all of them when using a small database. The technique also identified proteins with more than 100-fold abundance differences in a high dynamic range standard. When applied to protein identification in gel slices, {AIF} unambiguously characterized an immunoprecipitated protein that was barely visible by Coomassie staining and quantified it relative to contaminating proteins. {AIF} on a benchtop orbitrap instrument is therefore an attractive technology for a wide range of proteomics analyses.},

Its protein sequences are retrieved from predominant, publicly accessible resources. All new and updated protein sequences are collected and loaded daily into {UniParc} for full coverage. To avoid redundancy, each unique sequence is stored only once with a stable protein identifier, which can be used later in {UniParc} to identify the same protein in all source databases. When proteins are loaded into the database, database cross-references are created to link them to the origins of the sequences. As a result, performing a sequence search against {UniParc} is equivalent to performing the same search against all databases cross-referenced by {UniParc}. {UniParc} contains only protein sequences and database cross-references; all other information must be retrieved from the source databases.

Orbiting ions also perform harmonic oscillations along the electrode with frequency proportional to (m/z)-1/2. These oscillations are detected using image current detection and are transformed into mass spectra using fast {FT}, similarly to {FT} {ICR}. Practical aspects of the trap design are presented.

In this paper, we propose a new method{\textemdash}Peptide Element Alignment ({PETAL}) that uses raw spectrum data and detected peak to simultaneously align features from multiple {LC}-{MS} experiments. {PETAL} creates spectrum elements, each of which represents the mass spectrum of a single peptide in a single scan. Peptides detected in different {LC}-{MS} data are aligned if they can be represented by the same elements. By considering each peptide separately, {PETAL} enjoys greater flexibility than time warping methods. While most existing methods process multiple data sets by sequentially aligning each data set to an arbitrarily chosen template data set, {PETAL} treats all experiments symmetrically and can analyze all experiments simultaneously. We illustrate the performance of {PETAL} on example data sets.},

Because of the low and pulsed fragment ion currents, an array detector was used to record the spectra.

Formation of fragment ions from a large peptide (melittin, Mr 2844.75) was also observed.

Using this approach, C-reactive protein ({CRP}), a diagnostic marker of rheumatoid arthritis ({RA}), was detected in serum samples taken from patients with either erosive or nonerosive {RA} and compared to healthy individuals. Small volumes of serum samples were enriched for low-abundance proteins through the selective removal of human serum albumin ({HSA}), immunoglobulin G ({IgG}), and haptoglobin. After depletion of abundant proteins, the complexity of the protein mixture was further simplified using size exclusion chromatography ({SEC}) to fractionate denatured proteins into discrete molecular weight ranges. Fractions of interest containing {CRP}, M(r) = 25 000, were pooled, digested with trypsin, and then fixed quantities of the synthetic peptides were added to the mixture. The mixture of tryptic peptides was subsequently analyzed by nanoflow chromatography-tandem {MS} ({nanoLC}-{MS}/{MS}) using multiple-reaction monitoring ({MRM}) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ({TQ}-{MS}). The ratio of transition ions derived from the endogenous and isotope-labeled peptides provided a quantitative measure of {CRP} in the original samples as assessed by independent measurement of {CRP} in the same patient samples using an immunoassay. The use of isotope-labeled synthetic peptides and {MRM} is a powerful analytical method for the prescreening of candidate protein biomarkers in human serum prior to antibody and immunoassay development.},

Advanced spectrometry technologies and the development of new protein array formats have brought these analyses to a standard, which now has the potential to be used in clinical diagnostics. Besides standardization of methodologies and distribution of proteomic data into public databases, the nature of the human body fluid proteome with its high dynamic range in protein concentrations, its quantitation problems, and its extreme complexity present enormous challenges. Molecular cell biology (cytomics) with its link to proteomics is a new fast moving scientific field, which addresses functional cell analysis and bioinformatic approaches to search for novel cellular proteomic biomarkers or their release products into body fluids that provide better insight into the enormous biocomplexity of disease processes and are suitable for patient stratification, therapeutic monitoring, and prediction of prognosis. Experience from studies of in vitro diagnostics and especially in clinical chemistry showed that the majority of errors occurs in the preanalytical phase and the setup of the diagnostic strategy. This is also true for clinical proteomics where similar preanalytical variables such as inter- and intra-assay variability due to biological variations or proteolytical activities in the sample will most likely also influence the results of proteomics studies. However, before complex proteomic analysis can be introduced at a broader level into the clinic, standardization of the preanalytical phase including patient preparation, sample collection, sample preparation, sample storage, measurement, and data analysis is another issue which has to be improved. In this report, we discuss the recent advances and applications that fulfill the criteria for clinical proteomics with the focus on cellular proteomics (cytoproteomics) as related to preanalytical and analytical standardization and to quality control measures required for effective implementation of these technologies and analytes into routine laboratory testing to generate novel actionable health information. It will then be crucial to design and carry out clinical studies that can eventually identify novel clinical diagnostic strategies based on these techniques and validate their impact on clinical decision making.},

	abstract = {Label-free quantification ({LFQ}) based on data-independent acquisition workflows currently experiences increasing popularity. Several software tools have been recently published or are commercially available. The present study focuses on the evaluation of three different software packages (Progenesis, synapter, and {ISOQuant}) supporting ion mobility enhanced data-independent acquisition data. In order to benchmark the {LFQ} performance of the different tools, we generated two hybrid proteome samples of defined quantitative composition containing tryptically digested proteomes of three different species (mouse, yeast, Escherichia coli). This model dataset simulates complex biological samples containing large numbers of both unregulated (background) proteins as well as up- and downregulated proteins with exactly known ratios between samples. We determined the number and dynamic range of quantifiable proteins and analyzed the influence of applied algorithms (retention time alignment, clustering, normalization, etc.) on quantification results. Analysis of technical reproducibility revealed median coefficients of variation of reported protein abundances below 5\% for {MSE} data for Progenesis and {ISOQuant}. Regarding accuracy of {LFQ}, evaluation with synapter and {ISOQuant} yielded superior results compared to Progenesis. In addition, we discuss reporting formats and user friendliness of the software packages. The data generated in this study have been deposited to the {ProteomeXchange} Consortium with identifier {PXD}001240 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/{PXD}001240).},

The program achieves a time of typically 1 s per image point, permitting an analysis made up of large numbers of points with high spatial resolution up to 850 dpi. The features of the software are demonstrated in this paper with samples of printed images, where visible images can be compared to those obtained by mass spectrometry.

These patterns can be quite complex, in particular with in vivo metabolic labeling experiments producing fractional atomic labeling or fractional residue labeling of peptides or other macromolecules. In general, it can be difficult to distinguish the contributions of species with different labeling patterns to an experimental spectrum and difficult to calculate a theoretical isotope distribution to fit such data. There is a need for interactive and user-friendly software that can calculate and fit the entire isotope distribution of a complex mixture while comparing these calculations with experimental data and extracting the contributions from the differently labeled species.

Stable isotope labeling is a powerful method for accurately determining changes in the levels of proteins and {PTMs}; however, isotope labeling experiments suffer from limited dynamic range resulting in signal change ratios of less than \~{}20:1 using most commercial mass spectrometers. Label-free approaches to relative quantification in proteomics such as spectral counting have gained popularity since no additional chemistries are needed. Here, we show a label-free method for relative quantification based on the {TIC} from peptide {MS}/{MS} spectra collected from data-dependent runs can be used effectively as a quantitative measure and expands the dynamic range over isotope labeling experiments allowing for abundance differences up to \~{}60:1 in a screen for proteins that bind to phosphotyrosine residues.},

Given the immense benefit that high resolution and accurate mass instruments have brought to the discovery proteomics field, we wondered if highly accurate mass measurement capabilities could be leveraged to provide benefits in the targeted proteomics domain as well. Here, we propose a new targeted proteomics paradigm centered on the use of next generation, quadrupole-equipped high resolution and accurate mass instruments: parallel reaction monitoring ({PRM}). In {PRM}, the third quadrupole of a triple quadrupole is substituted with a high resolution and accurate mass mass analyzer to permit the parallel detection of all target product ions in one, concerted high resolution mass analysis. We detail the analytical performance of the {PRM} method, using a quadrupole-equipped bench-top Orbitrap {MS}, and draw a performance comparison to selected reaction monitoring in terms of run-to-run reproducibility, dynamic range, and measurement accuracy. In addition to requiring minimal upfront method development and facilitating automated data analysis, {PRM} yielded quantitative data over a wider dynamic range than selected reaction monitoring in the presence of a yeast background matrix because of {PRM}'s high selectivity in the mass-to-charge domain. With achievable linearity over the quantifiable dynamic range found to be statistically equal between the two methods, our investigation suggests that {PRM} will be a promising new addition to the quantitative proteomics toolbox.},

The recently introduced quadrupole Orbitrap (Q Exactive) tandem mass spectrometer allows fast acquisition of high-resolution higher-energy collisional dissociation ({HCD}) tandem mass spectra due to the parallel mode of operation, where the generation, filling, and storage of fragment ions can be performed while simultaneously measuring another ion packet in the Orbitrap mass analyzer. In this study, data-dependent acquisition methods for ?fast? or ?sensitive? scanning were optimized and assessed by comparing stable isotope labeled yeast proteome coverage. We discovered that speed was the most important parameter for sample loads above 125 ng, where a 95 ms {HCD} scanning method allowed for identification and quantification of more than 2000 yeast proteins from 1 h of analysis time. At sample loads below 125 ng, a 156 ms {HCD} acquisition method improved the sensitivity, mass accuracy, and quality of data and enabled us to identify 30\% more proteins and peptides than the faster scanning method. A similar effect was observed when the {LC} gradient was extended to 2 or 3 h for the analysis of complex mammalian whole cell lysates. Using a 3 h {LC} gradient, the sensitive method enabled identification of more than 4000 proteins from 1 ?g of tryptic {HeLa} digest, which was almost 200 more identifications compared to the faster scanning method. Our results demonstrate that peptide identification on a quadrupole Orbitrap is dependent on sample amounts, acquisition speed, and data quality, which emphasizes the need for acquisition methods tailored for different sample loads and analytical preferences.},

When searching peptide fragmentation spectra against sequence databases, potentially matching peptide sequences can be required to conform to tryptic specificity, namely, cleavage exclusively C-terminal to arginine or lysine. In many published reports, however, significant numbers of proteins are identified by non-tryptic peptides. Here we use the sub-parts per million mass accuracy of a new ion trap Fourier transform mass spectrometer to achieve more than a 100-fold increased confidence in peptide identification compared with typical ion trap experiments and show that trypsin cleaves solely C-terminal to arginine and lysine. We find that non-tryptic peptides occur only as the C-terminal peptides of proteins and as breakup products of fully tryptic peptides N-terminal to an internal proline. Simulating lower mass accuracy led to a large number of proteins erroneously identified with non-tryptic peptide hits. Our results indicate that such peptide hits in previous studies should be re-examined and that peptide identification should be based on strict trypsin specificity.},

At this 4th Spring workshop, the emphasis was on consolidating this effort, refining and improving the existing models and in pushing these forward to align with more broadly encompassing efforts such as {FuGE} (Jones, A.R., Pizarro, A., Spellman, P., Miller, M., {FuGE} Working Group {FuGE}: Functional Genomics Experiment Object Model. {OMICS} 2006, 10, 179-184) and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigation ({OBI}). The effort to merge the existing mass spectrometry {XML} interchange formats, {mzData} and {mzXML}, into one single standard {mzML} yielded significant progress. Also the preliminary design of {AnalysisXML} was extended to include several new use cases and better support for quantification information. Finally the Molecular Interaction group discussed the development of a molecular interaction scoring system with accompanying gold standard data test sets.},

Arbitrary abundances of peptides were obtained from three sample sets, including a standard protein sample, two Deinococcus radiodurans samples taken from different growth phases, and two mouse striatum samples from control and methamphetamine-stressed mice (strain C57BL/6). The selected normalization techniques were evaluated in both the absence and presence of biological variability by estimating extraneous variability prior to and following normalization. Prior to normalization, replicate runs from each sample set were observed to be statistically different, while following normalization replicate runs were no longer statistically different. Although all techniques reduced systematic bias to some degree, assigned ranks among the techniques revealed that for most {LC}?{FTICR}?{MS} analyses linear regression normalization ranked either first or second. However, the lack of a definitive trend among the techniques suggested the need for additional investigation into adapting normalization approaches for label-free proteomics. Nevertheless, this study serves as an important step for evaluating approaches that address systematic biases related to relative quantification and label-free proteomics.

	abstract = {The use of radio-frequency ({RF})-only ion guides for efficient transport of ions through regions of a mass spectrometer where the background gas pressure is relatively high is widespread in present instrumentation. Whilst multiple collisions between ions and the background gas can be beneficial, for example in inducing fragmentation and/or decreasing the spread in ion energies, the resultant reduction of ion axial velocity can be detrimental in modes of operation where a rapidly changing influx of ions to the gas-filled ion guide needs to be reproduced at the exit. In general, the {RF}-only ion guides presently in use are based on multipole rod sets. Here we report investigations into a new mode of ion propulsion within an {RF} ion guide based on a stack of ring electrodes. Ion propulsion is produced by superimposing a voltage pulse on the confining {RF} of an electrode and then moving the pulse to an adjacent electrode and so on along the guide to provide a travelling voltage wave on which the ions can surf. Through appropriate choice of the travelling wave pulse height, velocity and gas pressure it will be shown that the stacked ring ion guide with the travelling wave is effective as a collision cell in a tandem mass spectrometer where fast mass scanning or switching is required, as an ion mobility separator at pressures around 0.2 mbar, as an ion delivery device for enhancement of duty cycle on an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight (oa-{TOF}) mass analyser, and as an ion fragmentation device at higher wave velocities.},

	abstract = {The quantification of differences between two or more physiological states of a biological system is among the most important but also most challenging technical tasks in proteomics. In addition to the classical methods of differential protein gel or blot staining by dyes and fluorophores, mass-spectrometry-based quantification methods have gained increasing popularity over the past five years. Most of these methods employ differential stable isotope labeling to create a specific mass tag that can be recognized by a mass spectrometer and at the same time provide the basis for quantification. These mass tags can be introduced into proteins or peptides (i) metabolically, (ii) by chemical means, (iii) enzymatically, or (iv) provided by spiked synthetic peptide standards. In contrast, label-free quantification approaches aim to correlate the mass spectrometric signal of intact proteolytic peptides or the number of peptide sequencing events with the relative or absolute protein quantity directly. In this review, we critically examine the more commonly used quantitative mass spectrometry methods for their individual merits and discuss challenges in arriving at meaningful interpretations of quantitative proteomic data.

Despite its common use, there are a wide range of parameters and conditions used across research groups. These parameters have an effect on the quality of the chromatographic separation, which is critical to maximizing the number of peptide identifications and minimizing ion suppression. Here we examined the relationship between column lengths, gradient lengths, peptide identifications, and peptide peak capacity. We found that while longer column and gradient lengths generally increase peptide identifications, the degree of improvement is dependent on both parameters and is diminished at longer column and gradients. Peak capacity, in comparison, showed a more linear increase with column and gradient lengths. We discuss the discrepancy between these two results and some of the considerations that should be taken into account when deciding on the chromatographic conditions for a proteomics experiment.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryAn} accurate diagnosis of parasitic worm (helminth) infections is important for adequate patient treatment and disease control programs. Helminth eggs in human stool samples are used as an indicator of infection intensity and morbidity. However, little is known about the exact distribution of helminth eggs in stool samples. Homogenization has been suggested to improve the diagnostic accuracy. Hookworm eggs disintegrate over time, which makes their detection challenging in epidemiological surveys. We determined the location of helminth eggs in entire stool samples from 222 individuals in C{\^o}te d'Ivoire. We also investigated whether homogenization has an effect on the detection of eggs, and determined egg counts over time in stool samples stored on ice, covered with a moist tissue, or kept in the shade. No clear pattern of helminth egg distribution was found in human stool samples. Homogenization resulted in more accurate egg counts of the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni, while it did not affect other helminths. Keeping stool samples on ice or covered with a wet tissue slows down the disintegration of hookworm eggs. Our findings have important implications for individual patient management and the design and implementation of epidemiological surveys and helminth disease control programs.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) and combined with tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS}) have become a prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomic samples. An important step in a typical workflow is the combination of results from multiple {LC}-{MS} experiments to improve confidence in the obtained measurements or to compare results from different samples. To do so, a suitable mapping or alignment between the data sets needs to be estimated. The alignment has to correct for variations in mass and elution time which are present in all mass spectrometry experiments.
{RESULTS}: We propose a novel algorithm to align {LC}-{MS} samples and to match corresponding ion species across samples. Our algorithm matches landmark signals between two data sets using a geometric technique based on pose clustering. Variations in mass and retention time are corrected by an affine dewarping function estimated from matched landmarks. We use the pairwise dewarping in an algorithm for aligning multiple samples. We show that our pose clustering approach is fast and reliable as compared to previous approaches. It is robust in the presence of noise and able to accurately align samples with only few common ion species. In addition, we can easily handle different kinds of {LC}-{MS} data and adopt our algorithm to new mass spectrometry technologies.

 that mass spectrometric protein identification is a general solution to
 this problem given a completely sequenced genome. As a first screen,
 our strategy uses automated laser desorption ionization mass
 spectrometry of the peptide mixtures produced by in-gel tryptic
 digestion of a protein. Up to 90\% of proteins are identified by
 searching sequence data bases by lists of peptide masses obtained with
 high accuracy. The remaining proteins are identified by partially
 sequencing several peptides of the unseparated mixture by
 nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry followed by data base
 searching with multiple peptide sequence tags. In blind trials,
 the method led to unambiguous identification in all cases. In the
 largest individual protein identification project to date, a total of
 150 gel spots{\textemdash}many of them at subpicomole amounts{\textemdash}were successfully
 analyzed, greatly enlarging a yeast two-dimensional gel data base. More
 than 32 proteins were novel and matched to previously uncharacterized
 open reading frames in the yeast genome. This study establishes that
 mass spectrometry provides the required throughput, the certainty of
 identification, and the general applicability to serve as the method of

Although this technique is powerful, mature, and sensitive, questions remain concerning its ability to characterize all of the elements of a proteome. In the current study, more than 1,500 features were visualized by silver staining a narrow {pH} range (4.9-5.7) 2D gel in which 0.5 mg of total soluble yeast protein was separated. Fifty spots migrating to a region of 4 cm2 were subjected to {MS} protein identification. Despite the high sample load and extended electrophoretic separation, proteins from genes with codon bias values of {\textless}0.1 (lower abundance proteins) were not found, even though fully one-half of all yeast genes fall into that range. Proteins from genes with codon bias values of {\textless}0.1 were found, however, if protein amounts exceeding the capacity of 2DE were fractionated and analyzed. We conclude that the large range of protein expression levels limits the ability of the 2DE-{MS} approach to analyze proteins of medium to low abundance, and thus the potential of this technique for proteome analysis is likewise limited.},

	abstract = {The use of chemometric data processing is becoming an important part of modern chromatography. Most chemometric analyses are performed on reduced data sets using areas of selected peaks detected in the chromatograms, which means a loss of data and introduces the problem of extracting peak data from the chromatographic profiles. These disadvantages can be overcome by using the entire chromatographic data matrix in chemometric analyses, but it is necessary to align the chromatograms, as small unavoidable differences in experimental conditions causes minor changes and drift. Previous aligning methods either fail to utilise the entire data matrix or rely on peak detection, thus having the same limitations as the commonly used chemometric procedures. The method presented uses the entire chromatographic data matrices and does not require any preprocessing e.g., peak detection. It relies on piecewise linear correlation optimised warping ({COW}) using two input parameters which can be estimated from the observed peak width. {COW} is demonstrated on constructed single trace chromatograms and on single and multiple wavelength chromatograms obtained from {HPLC} diode detection analyses of fungal extracts1A copy of the C program containing the {COW} implementation used in this work may be obtained at http://www.imm.dtu.dk/{\textasciitilde}jmc/papers/cow/cow.html

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed a relationship between protein abundance and sampling statistics, such as sequence coverage, peptide count, and spectral count, in label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS}) shotgun proteomics. The use of sampling statistics offers a promising method of measuring relative protein abundance and detecting differentially expressed or coexpressed proteins. We performed a systematic analysis of various approaches to quantifying differential protein expression in eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae and prokaryotic Rhodopseudomonas palustris label-free {LC}-{MS}/{MS} data. First, we showed that, among three sampling statistics, the spectral count has the highest technical reproducibility, followed by the less-reproducible peptide count and relatively nonreproducible sequence coverage. Second, we used spectral count statistics to measure differential protein expression in pairwise experiments using five statistical tests: Fisher's exact test, G-test, {AC} test, t-test, and {LPE} test. Given the S. cerevisiae data set with spiked proteins as a benchmark and the false positive rate as a metric, our evaluation suggested that the Fisher's exact test, G-test, and {AC} test can be used when the number of replications is limited (one or two), whereas the t-test is useful with three or more replicates available. Third, we generalized the G-test to increase the sensitivity of detecting differential protein expression under multiple experimental conditions. Out of 1622 identified R. palustris proteins in the {LC}-{MS}/{MS} experiment, the generalized G-test detected 1119 differentially expressed proteins under six growth conditions. Finally, we studied correlated expression of these 1119 proteins by analyzing pairwise expression correlations and by delineating protein clusters according to expression patterns. Through pairwise expression correlation analysis, we demonstrated that proteins co-located in the same operon were much more strongly coexpressed than those from different operons. Combining cluster analysis with existing protein functional annotations, we identified six protein clusters with known biological significance. In summary, the proposed generalized G-test using spectral count sampling statistics is a viable methodology for robust quantification of relative protein abundance and for sensitive detection of biologically significant differential protein expression under multiple experimental conditions in label-free shotgun proteomics.},

Thus, experiments in which the collision energy is varied give energy-resolved mass spectra ({ERMS}) which correspond to those observed in the analogous gas-phase experiments. While both methods of activation display the same fragment ions, significant differences in the amount of energy deposited are observed between the two methods. At low collision energy, {SID} gives essentially no dissociation. On the other hand, selection of higher collision energies can result in deposition of even larger amounts of internal energy than are available from the comparable gas-phase collisional processes at either low ({eV}) or high ({keV}) energy.},

	abstract = {The detection, correlation, and comparison of peptide and product ions from a data independent {LC}-{MS} acquisition strategy with data dependent {LC}-{MS}/{MS} is described. The data independent mode of acquisition differs from an {LC}-{MS}/{MS} data acquisition since no ion transmission window is applied with the first mass analyzer prior to collision induced disassociation. Alternating the energy applied to the collision cell, between low and elevated energy, on a scan-to-scan basis, provides accurate mass precursor and associated product ion spectra from every ion above the {LOD} of the mass spectrometer. The method therefore provides a near 100\% duty cycle, with an inherent increase in signal intensity due to the fact that both precursor and product ion data are collected on all isotopes of every charge-state across the entire chromatographic peak width. The correlation of product to precursor ions, after deconvolution, is achieved by using reconstructed retention time apices and chromatographic peak shapes. Presented are the results from the comparison of a simple four protein mixture, in the presence and absence of an enzymatically digested protein extract from Escherichia coli. The samples were run in triplicate by both data dependant analysis ({DDA}) {LC}-{MS}/{MS} and data-independent, alternate scanning {LC}-{MS}. The detection and identification of precursor and product ions from the combined {DDA} search results of the four protein mixture were used for comparison to all other data. Each individual set of data-independent {LC}-{MS} data provides a more comprehensive set of detected ions than the combined peptide identifications from the {DDA} {LC}-{MS}/{MS} experiments. In the presence of the complex E. coli background, over 90\% of the monoisotopic masses from the combined {LC}-{MS}/{MS} identifications were detected at the appropriate retention time. Moreover, the fragmentation pattern and number of associated elevated energy product ions in each replicate experiment was found to be very similar to the {DDA} identifications. In the case of the corresponding individual {DDA} {LC}-{MS}/{MS} experiment, 43\% of the possible detectable peptides of interest were identified. The presented data illustrates that the time-aligned data from data-independent alternate scanning {LC}-{MS} experiments is highly comparable to the data obtained via {DDA}. The obtained information can therefore be effectively and correctly deconvolved to correlate product ions with parent precursor ions. The ability to generate precursor-product ion tables from this information and subsequently identify the correct parent precursor peptide will be illustrated in a companion manuscript.},

With increasing capillary potential two pulsating and one continuous axial spray mode could be distinguished. Pulsations with frequencies in the low kilohertz range are related to a transient emission of liquid via a cone jet and are caused by an imbalance between the emission rate of liquid and its supply rate to the apex of the cone. Low frequency pulsations of a sequence of emission pulses are due to an imbalance between the supply of liquid to the cone volume and its loss by a sequence of emission pulses. A mechanism of the disintegration of the jet into charged droplets is proposed. The dependence of the pulsations on the flow rate, electrolyte concentration, surface tension, and capillary diameter is shown. Mass spectrometry revealed that high ion signal intensities are obtained at higher capillary potentials in the continuous axial spray mode and at lower capillary potentials in the transition range between the two pulsating axial spray modes because of the formation of small highly charged droplets. In experiments with nanoelectrospray capillaries, current pulsations were observed only after the onset of a (corona) discharge.},

The rise of systems biology implied a growing demand for highly sensitive techniques for the fast and consistent detection and quantification of target sets of proteins across multiple samples. This is only~partly achieved by classical mass spectrometry or affinity-based methods. We applied a targeted proteomics approach based on selected reaction monitoring ({SRM}) to detect and quantify proteins expressed to a concentration below 50 copies/cell in total S. cerevisiae digests. The detection range can be extended to single-digit copies/cell and to proteins undetected by classical methods. We illustrate the power of the technique by the consistent and fast measurement of a network of proteins spanning the entire abundance range over a growth time course of S. cerevisiae transiting through~a series of metabolic phases. We therefore demonstrate the potential of {SRM}-based proteomics to provide assays for the measurement of any set of proteins of interest in yeast at high-throughput and quantitative accuracy.},

This highly selective information can be extracted by multiway modelling. However, for full use and interpretability it is necessary that the assumptions made for the model are valid. For {PARAFAC} modelling, the assumption is a trilinear data structure. With {LC}{\textendash}{MS}, several factors, e.g. non-linear detector response and ionisation suppression may introduce deviations from trilinearity. The single largest problem, however, is the retention time shifts not related to the true sample variations. In this paper, a time warping algorithm for alignment of {LC}{\textendash}{MS} data in the chromatographic direction has been examined. Several refinements have been implemented and the features are demonstrated for both simulated and real data. With moderate time shifts present in the data, pre-processing with this algorithm yields approximately trilinear data for which reasonable models can be made.},

However, the availability of standard labeled signature peptides in accurately known amounts is a limitation to the widespread adoption of this approach. We describe the design and synthesis of artificial {QconCAT} proteins that are concatamers of tryptic peptides for several proteins. This protocol details the methods for the design, expression, labeling, purification, characterization and use of the {QconCATs} in the absolute quantification of complex protein mixtures. The total time required to complete this protocol (from the receipt of the {QconCAT} expression plasmid to the absolute quantification of the set of proteins encoded by the {QconCAT} protein in an analyte sample) is 29 d.},

	abstract = {This review article compares and contrasts various types of ion mobility{\textendash}mass spectrometers available today and describes their advantages for application to a wide range of analytes. Ion mobility spectrometry ({IMS}), when coupled with mass spectrometry, offers value-added data not possible from mass spectra alone. Separation of isomers, isobars, and conformers; reduction of chemical noise; and measurement of ion size are possible with the addition of ion mobility cells to mass spectrometers. In addition, structurally similar ions and ions of the same charge state can be separated into families of ions which appear along a unique mass-mobility correlation line. This review describes the four methods of ion mobility separation currently used with mass spectrometry. They are (1) drift-time ion mobility spectrometry ({DTIMS}), (2) aspiration ion mobility spectrometry ({AIMS}), (3) differential-mobility spectrometry ({DMS}) which is also called field-asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry ({FAIMS}) and (4) traveling-wave ion mobility spectrometry ({TWIMS}). {DTIMS} provides the highest {IMS} resolving power and is the only {IMS} method which can directly measure collision cross-sections. {AIMS} is a low resolution mobility separation method but can monitor ions in a continuous manner. {DMS} and {FAIMS} offer continuous-ion monitoring capability as well as orthogonal ion mobility separation in which high-separation selectivity can be achieved. {TWIMS} is a novel method of {IMS} with a low resolving power but has good sensitivity and is well intergrated into a commercial mass spectrometer.

	abstract = {Mass spectrometry proteomics typically relies upon analyzing outcomes of single analyses; however, comparing raw data across multiple experiments should enhance both peptide/protein identification and quantitation. In the absence of convincing tandem {MS} identifications, comparing peptide quantities between experiments (or fractions) requires the chromatographic alignment of {MS} signals. An extension of dynamic time warping ({DTW}), termed ordered bijective interpolated warping ({OBI}-Warp), is presented and used to align a variety of electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ({ESI}-{LC}-{MS}) proteomics data sets. An algorithm to produce a bijective (one-to-one) function from {DTW} output is coupled with piecewise cubic hermite interpolation to produce a smooth warping function. Data sets were chosen to represent a broad selection of {ESI}-{LC}-{MS} alignment cases. High confidence, overlapping tandem mass spectra are used as standards to optimize and compare alignment parameters. We determine that Pearson's correlation coefficient as a measure of spectra similarity outperforms covariance, dot product, and Euclidean distance in its ability to produce correct alignments with optimal and suboptimal alignment parameters. We demonstrate the importance of penalizing gaps for best alignments. Using optimized parameters, we show that {OBI}-Warp produces alignments consistent with time standards across these data sets.

Recent genomewide studies describe patterns of covalent modifications, such as H3 methylation and acetylation at promoters of specific target genes, or {\textquotedblleft}bivalent domains,{\textquotedblright} in stem cells, suggestive of a possible combinatorial interplay between {PTMs} on the same histone. However, detection of long-range {PTM} associations is often problematic in antibody-based or traditional mass spectrometric-based analyses. Here, histone H3 from a ciliate model was analyzed as an enriched source of transcriptionally active chromatin. Using a recently developed mass spectrometric approach, combinatorial modification states on single, long N-terminal H3 fragments (residues 1{\textendash}50) were determined. The entire modification status of intact N termini was obtained and indicated correlations between K4 methylation and H3 acetylation. In addition, K4 and K27 methylation were identified concurrently on one H3 species. This methodology is applicable to other histones and larger polypeptides and will likely be a valuable tool in understanding the roles of combinatorial patterns of {PTMs}.},

Since reproducible results are essential for comparative studies, we explain how we improved reproducibility at every step of our laboratory processes, e.g. by taking advantage of the powerful laboratory information management system we developed. The differential capacity of our platform is validated by detecting known markers in a real sample and by a spiking experiment. We introduce an innovative two-dimensional (2-D) plot for displaying identification results combined with chromatographic data. This 2-D plot is very convenient for detecting differential proteins. We also adapt standard multivariate statistical techniques to show that peptide identification scores can be used for reliable and sensitive differential studies. The interest of the protein separation approach we generally apply is justified by numerous statistics, complemented by a comparison with a simple shotgun analysis performed on a small volume sample. By introducing an automatic integration step after mass spectrometry data identification, we are able to search numerous databases systematically, including the human genome and expressed sequence tags. Finally, we explain how rigorous data processing can be combined with the work of human experts to set high quality standards, and hence obtain reliable (false positive {\textless} 0.35\%) and nonredundant protein identifications.},

Data on absolute molecule numbers will empower the modeling, understanding, and comparison of cellular functions and biological systems. We quantified transcriptomes and proteomes in fission yeast during cellular proliferation and quiescence. This rich resource provides the first comprehensive reference for all {RNA} and most protein concentrations in~a eukaryote under two key physiological conditions. The integrated data set supports quantitative biology and affords unique insights into cell regulation. Although {mRNAs} are typically expressed in a narrow range above 1 copy/cell, most long, noncoding {RNAs}, except for a distinct subset, are tightly repressed below 1 copy/cell. Cell-cycle-regulated transcription tunes {mRNA} numbers to phase-specific requirements but can also bring about more switch-like expression. Proteins greatly exceed {mRNAs} in abundance and dynamic range, and concentrations are regulated to functional demands. Upon transition to quiescence, the proteome changes substantially, but, in stark contrast to {mRNAs}, proteins do not uniformly decrease but scale with cell volume.},

	abstract = {Most proteomic studies use liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the peptides generated by the proteolysis of a biological sample. However, with the current methods it remains challenging to rapidly, consistently, reproducibly, accurately, and sensitively detect and quantify large fractions of proteomes across multiple samples. Here we present a new strategy that systematically queries sample sets for the presence and quantity of essentially any protein of interest. It consists of using the information available in fragment ion spectral libraries to mine the complete fragment ion maps generated using a data-independent acquisition method. For this study, the data were acquired on a fast, high resolution quadrupole-quadrupole time-of-flight ({TOF}) instrument by repeatedly cycling through 32 consecutive 25-Da precursor isolation windows (swaths). This {SWATH} {MS} acquisition setup generates, in a single sample injection, time-resolved fragment ion spectra for all the analytes detectable within the 400-1200 m/z precursor range and the user-defined retention time window. We show that suitable combinations of fragment ions extracted from these data sets are sufficiently specific to confidently identify query peptides over a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude, even if the precursors of the queried peptides are not detectable in the survey scans. We also show that queried peptides are quantified with a consistency and accuracy comparable with that of selected reaction monitoring, the gold standard proteomic quantification method. Moreover, targeted data extraction enables ad libitum quantification refinement and dynamic extension of protein probing by iterative re-mining of the once-and-forever acquired data sets. This combination of unbiased, broad range precursor ion fragmentation and targeted data extraction alleviates most constraints of present proteomic methods and should be equally applicable to the comprehensive analysis of other classes of analytes, beyond proteomics.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) has been widely used for profiling expression levels of biomolecules in various '-omic' studies including proteomics, metabolomics and glycomics. Appropriate {LC}-{MS} data preprocessing steps are needed to detect true differences between biological groups. Retention time ({RT}) alignment, which is required to ensure that ion intensity measurements among multiple {LC}-{MS} runs are comparable, is one of the most important yet challenging preprocessing steps. Current alignment approaches estimate {RT} variability using either single chromatograms or detected peaks, but do not simultaneously take into account the complementary information embedded in the entire {LC}-{MS} data.
{RESULTS}: We propose a Bayesian alignment model for {LC}-{MS} data analysis. The alignment model provides estimates of the {RT} variability along with uncertainty measures. The model enables integration of multiple sources of information including internal standards and clustered chromatograms in a mathematically rigorous framework. We apply the model to {LC}-{MS} metabolomic, proteomic and glycomic data. The performance of the model is evaluated based on ground-truth data, by measuring correlation of variation, {RT} difference across runs and peak-matching performance. We demonstrate that Bayesian alignment model improves significantly the {RT} alignment performance through appropriate integration of relevant information.

	abstract = {Assessment of differential protein abundance from the observed properties of detected peptides is an essential part of protein profiling based on shotgun proteomics. However, the abundance observed for shared peptides may be due to contributions from multiple proteins that are affected differently by a given treatment. Excluding shared peptides eliminates this ambiguity but may significantly decrease the number of proteins for which abundance estimates can be obtained. Peptide sharing within a family of biologically related proteins does not cause ambiguity if family members have a common response to treatment. On the basis of this concept, we have developed an approach for including shared peptides in the analysis of differential protein abundance in protein profiling. Data from a recent proteomics study of lung tissue from mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide, cigarette smoke, and a combination of these agents are used to illustrate our method. Starting from data where about half of the implicated database protein involved shared peptides, 82\% of the affected proteins were grouped into families, based on {FASTA} annotation, with closure on peptide sharing. In many cases, a common abundance relative to control was sufficient to explain ion-current peak areas for peptides, both unique and shared, that identified biologically related proteins in a peptide-sharing closure group. On the basis of these results, we propose that peptide-sharing closure groups provide a way to include abundance data for shared peptides in quantitative protein profiling by high-throughput mass spectrometry.},

A variable selection procedure was developed that selects mass chromatograms with low noise and low background; these mass chromatograms are then combined to form a reduced total ion chromatogram ({TIC}) trace. This is achieved by calculating a ?similarity index? between each original mass chromatogram and its smoothed and mean-subtracted version. It is further shown that it is possible to reduce the number of mass chromatograms by more than an order of magnitude without losing chemically significant information. The process results in significantly improved chromatograms and a significant reduction in data analysis times for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.

	abstract = {A novel database search algorithm is presented for the qualitative identification of proteins over a wide dynamic range, both in simple and complex biological samples. The algorithm has been designed for the analysis of data originating from data independent acquisitions, whereby multiple precursor ions are fragmented simultaneously. Measurements used by the algorithm include retention time, ion intensities, charge state, and accurate masses on both precursor and product ions from {LC}-{MS} data. The search algorithm uses an iterative process whereby each iteration incrementally increases the selectivity, specificity, and sensitivity of the overall strategy. Increased specificity is obtained by utilizing a subset database search approach, whereby for each subsequent stage of the search, only those peptides from securely identified proteins are queried. Tentative peptide and protein identifications are ranked and scored by their relative correlation to a number of models of known and empirically derived physicochemical attributes of proteins and peptides. In addition, the algorithm utilizes decoy database techniques for automatically determining the false positive identification rates. The search algorithm has been tested by comparing the search results from a four-protein mixture, the same four-protein mixture spiked into a complex biological background, and a variety of other "system" type protein digest mixtures. The method was validated independently by data dependent methods, while concurrently relying on replication and selectivity. Comparisons were also performed with other commercially and publicly available peptide fragmentation search algorithms. The presented results demonstrate the ability to correctly identify peptides and proteins from data independent acquisition strategies with high sensitivity and specificity. They also illustrate a more comprehensive analysis of the samples studied; providing approximately 20\% more protein identifications, compared to a more conventional data directed approach using the same identification criteria, with a concurrent increase in both sequence coverage and the number of modified peptides.},

	abstract = {A technique has been developed for the separation of proteins by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Due to its resolution and sensitivity, this technique is a powerful tool for the analysis and detection of proteins from complex biological sources. Proteins are separated according to isoelectric point by isoelectric focusing in the first dimension, and according to molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the second dimension. Since these two parameters are unrelated, it is possible to obtain an almost uniform distribution of protein spots across a two-diminsional gel. This technique has resolved 1100 different components from Escherichia coli and should be capable of resolving a maximum of 5000 proteins. A protein containing as little as one disintegration per min of either 14C or 35S can be detected by autoradiography. A protein which constitutes 10 minus 4 to 10 minus 5\% of the total protein can be detected and quantified by autoradiography. The reproducibility of the separation is sufficient to permit each spot on one separation to be matched with a spot on a different separation. This technique provides a method for estimation (at the described sensitivities) of the number of proteins made by any biological system. This system can resolve proteins differing in a single charge and consequently can be used in the analysis of in vivo modifications resulting in a change in charge. Proteins whose charge is changed by missense mutations can be identified. A detailed description of the methods as well as the characteristics of this system are presented.},

The proteins contained in total yeast cell lysate were separated by high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. Over 150 protein spots were excised and identified by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS}). Protein spots were quantified by metabolic labeling and scintillation counting. Corresponding {mRNA} levels were calculated from serial analysis of gene expression ({SAGE}) frequency tables (V. E. Velculescu, L. Zhang, W. Zhou, J. Vogelstein, M. A. Basrai, D. E. Bassett, Jr., P. Hieter, B. Vogelstein, and K. W. Kinzler, Cell 88:243{\textendash}251, 1997). We found that the correlation between {mRNA} and protein levels was insufficient to predict protein expression levels from quantitative {mRNA} data. Indeed, for some genes, while the {mRNA} levels were of the same value the protein levels varied by more than 20-fold. Conversely, invariant steady-state levels of certain proteins were observed with respective {mRNA} transcript levels that varied by as much as 30-fold. Another interesting observation is that codon bias is not a predictor of either protein or {mRNA} levels. Our results clearly delineate the technical boundaries of current approaches for quantitative analysis of protein expression and reveal that simple deduction from {mRNA} transcript analysis is insufficient.},

	abstract = {Two different algorithms for time-alignment as a preprocessing step in linear factor models are studied. Correlation optimized warping and dynamic time warping are both presented in the literature as methods that can eliminate shift-related artifacts from measurements by correcting a sample vector towards a reference. In this study both the theoretical properties and the practical implications of using signal warping as preprocessing for chromatographic data are investigated. The connection between the two algorithms is also discussed. The findings are illustrated by means of a case study of principal component analysis on a real data set, including manifest retention time artifacts, of extracts from coffee samples stored under different packaging conditions for varying storage times. We concluded that for the data presented here dynamic time warping with rigid slope constraints and correlation optimized warping are superior to unconstrained dynamic time warping; both considerably simplify interpretation of the factor model results. Unconstrained dynamic time warping was found to be too flexible for this chromatographic data set, resulting in an overcompensation of the observed shifts and suggesting the unsuitability of this preprocessing method for this type of signals.

Amino acid composition was used to putatively identify, or provide unique parameters, for 50 gene products separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A further 19 proteins were subjected to peptide-mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight ({MALDI}-{TOF}) mass spectrometry and 4 were subjected to N-terminal Edman degradation. The majority of M. genitalium proteins remain uncharacterised. However, the combined approach of amino acid analysis and peptide-mass fingerprinting allowed gene products to be linked to homologous genes in a variety of organisms. This has allowed proteins to be identified prior to detection of their respective genes via the M. genitalium sequencing initiative. The principle of {\textquoteleft}hierarchical{\textquoteright} analysis for the mass screening of proteins and the analysis of microbial genomes via their protein complement or {\textquoteleft}proteome{\textquoteright} is detailed. Here, characterisation of gene products depends upon the quickest and most economical technologies being employed initially, so as to determine if a large number of proteins are already present in both homologous and heterologous species databases. Initial screening, which lends itself to automation and robotics, can then be followed by more time and cost intensive procedures, when necessary.},

	abstract = {An octupole radio frequency (rf) ion guide was evaluated for storage and filtering of ions generated by electrospray prior to introduction into an ion trap mass spectrometer. The control of the rf potential on the ion guide enabled its operation as a high-pass mass filter, removing low-mass chemical noise that would normally fill the ion trap and result in reduced sensitivity, mass resolution, and dynamic range. Also, the ion guide can serve to store the high-pass filtered ions during the ion trap mass analysis, enabling nearly 100\% duty cycle and reduction of the cycle time by a factor of two. The linearity, precision, and detection limits of the liquid chromatography ({LC}) electrospray - ion guide-ion trap {MS}/{MS} system were evaluated for the determination of ceftiofur in milk. A linear calibration (linear correlation coefficient of 0.986) from 2{\textendash}200 ppb was obtained with a relative standard deviation for replicate analysis of less than 8\%. A quantitation detection limit of 100 pg of ceftiofur on-column (2 ppb) was achieved from a milk extract. This detection limit is nearly a factor of 10 lower compared with the determination on the same electrospray ion trap system not using a rf ion guide for high-pass mass filtering and ion storage.

This technique was used to sequence completely a 4257 bp {EcoRI} fragment of bovine mitochondrial {DNA}. The cloned fragments were evenly distributed with respect to the {EcoRI} fragment, and completion of the entire sequence required the construction of only a single library. In general, once a clone library has been prepared, the speed of this approach ({\textgreater}1000 nucleotides of randomly selected sequence per day) is limited mainly by the rate at which the data can be processed.

	abstract = {Background:Developments in {\textquoteleft}soft{\textquoteright} ionisation techniques have revolutionized mass-spectro-metric approaches for the analysis of protein structure. For more than a decade, such techniques have been used, in conjuction with digestion b specific proteases, to produce accurate peptide molecular weight {\textquoteleft}fingerprints{\textquoteright} of proteins. These fingerprints have commonly been used to screen known proteins, in order to detect errors of translation, to characterize post-translational modifications and to assign diulphide bonds. However, the extent to which peptide-mass information can be used alone to identify unknown sample proteins, independent of other analytical methods such as protein sequence analysis, has remained largely unexplored.
Results: We report here on the development of the molecular weight search ({MOWSE}) peptide-mass database at the {SERC} Daresbury Laboratory. Practical experience has shown that sample proteins can be uniquely identified from a few as three or four experimentally determined peptide masses when these are screened against a fragment database that is derived from over 50 000 proteins. Experimental errors of a few Daltons are tolerated by the scoring algorithms, thus permitting the use of inexpensive time-of-flight mass spectrometers. As with other types of physical data, such as amino-acid composition or linear sequence, peptide masses provide a set of determinants that are sufficiently discriminating to identify or match unknown sample proteins.
Conclusion: Peptide-mass fingerprints can prove as discriminating as linear peptide sequences, but can be obtained in a fraction of the time using less protein. In many cases, this allows for a rapid identification of a sample protein before committing it to protein sequence analysis. Fragment masses also provide information, at the protein level, that is complementary to the information provided by large-scale {DNA} sequencing or mapping projects.},

The current literature illustrates both pros and cons for each of the previously mentioned methodologies. Keeping with the teachings of William of Ockham, "with all things being equal the simplest solution tends to be correct", a simple {LC}/{MS} based methodology is presented that allows relative changes in abundance of proteins in highly complex mixtures to be determined. Utilizing a reproducible chromatographic separations system along with the high mass resolution and mass accuracy of an orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer, the quantitative comparison of tens of thousands of ions emanating from identically prepared control and experimental samples can be made. Using this configuration, we can determine the change in relative abundance of a small number of ions between the two conditions solely by accurate mass and retention time. Employing standard operating procedures for both sample preparation and {ESI}-mass spectrometry, one typically obtains under 5 ppm mass precision and quantitative variations between 10 and 15\%. The principal focus of this paper will demonstrate the quantitative aspects of the methodology and continue with a discussion of the associated, complementary qualitative capabilities.},

	abstract = {With the advent of recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid ({DNA}) technology which allows a wide range of manipulation of genes and their expression in cell lines other than the natural ones, many aspects of protein structure have become more important than ever. In addition to the determination of the amino acid sequence questions relating to homogeneity, the nature of post-translational modifications, the verification of the structure of a protein produced by a synthetically modified gene or the detection of a natural mutant are all questions that are more and more frequently asked and with the demand for more detail. Mass spectrometry has emerged as an important contributor to this field, particularly since the advent of fast atom bombardment ({FAB}) ionization, which makes it possible to ionize directly large polar molecules such as peptides and small proteins. As such, {FAB} mass spectrometry provides mainly molecular weight information which, in itself, often suffices to answer certain questions, particularly because the mass of many peptides can be determined directly from a single mass spectrum of a mixture. However, in order to obtain detailed structural information, such as the amino acid sequence, fragmentation has to be induced by collision processes and the product ions separated, preferably in the second mass spectrometer of a tandem system. This approach is particularly suited for the determination of the sequence of N-blocked peptides and the nature of the blocking group; the type and location of modified (i.e. phosphorylated, sulfated, glycosylated) amino acids; detection or verification of amino acid replacements; confirmation of the structure of synthetic peptides; and last but not least, the determination of the primary structure of proteins.},

	abstract = {Relative quantification methods have dominated the quantitative proteomics field. There is a need, however, to conduct absolute quantification studies to accurately model and understand the complex molecular biology that results in proteome variability among biological samples. A new method of absolute quantification of proteins is described. This method is based on the discovery of an unexpected relationship between {MS} signal response and protein concentration: the average {MS} signal response for the three most intense tryptic peptides per mole of protein is constant within a coefficient of variation of less than +/-10\%. Given an internal standard, this relationship is used to calculate a universal signal response factor. The universal signal response factor (counts/mol) was shown to be the same for all proteins tested in this study. A controlled set of six exogenous proteins of varying concentrations was studied in the absence and presence of human serum. The absolute quantity of the standard proteins was determined with a relative error of less than +/-15\%. The average {MS} signal responses of the three most intense peptides from each protein were plotted against their calculated protein concentrations, and this plot resulted in a linear relationship with an R(2) value of 0.9939. The analyses were applied to determine the absolute concentration of 11 common serum proteins, and these concentrations were then compared with known values available in the literature. Additionally within an unfractionated Escherichia coli lysate, a subset of identified proteins known to exist as functional complexes was studied. The calculated absolute quantities were used to accurately determine their stoichiometry.},

	abstract = {Low-flow electrospray ionization is typically a purely electrostatic method, used without supporting sheath-gas nebulization. Complex spray morphology results from a large number of possible spray emission modes. Spray morphology may assume the optimal Taylor cone-jet spray mode under equilibrium conditions. When coupling to nanobore gradient elution chromatography, however, stability of the Taylor cone-jet spray mode is compromised by the gradient of mobile phase physiochemical properties. The common spray modes for aqueous/organic mobile phases were characterized using orthogonal (strobed illumination) transmitted light and (continuous illumination) scattered light imaging. Correlation of image sets from these complementary illumination methods provides the basis for spray mode identification using qualitative and quantitative image analysis. An automated feedback-controlled electrospray source was developed on a computer capable of controlling electrospray potential using an image-processing based algorithm for spray mode identification. The implementation of the feedback loop results in a system that is both self-starting and self-tuning for a specific spray mode or modes. Thus, changes in mobile phase composition and/or flow rate are compensated in real-time and the source is maintained in the cone-jet or pulsed cone-jet spray modes.},

	abstract = {This review discusses the off-line and on-line coupling of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization ({MALDI}) mass spectrometry to liquid chromatography ({LC}) and capillary electrophoresis ({CE}). Off-line methods involve collecting fractions or depositing a sample on a prepared target prior to {MALDI} analysis. Because {LC} fraction collection is straightforward, off-line {MALDI} {LC}-{MS} is relatively easy to implement and widely used. Collecting {CE} fractions poses a greater challenge due to the small sample volume and the high voltage electrical connection that must be maintained during separation. Methods for off-line {MALDI} {CE}-{MS} employing a porous glass joint, liquid sheath flow, low-volume buffer, or direct deposition are discussed. On-line coupling of {MALDI} to liquid separations involves introducing the sample directly into the mass spectrometer, using either a continuous-flow ({CF}) probe or an aerosol spray. With {CF} {MALDI}, liquid samples are delivered to the probe through a silica capillary. Aerosol {MALDI} relies on a pneumatic nebulizer to deliver samples to the mass spectrometer, where ions are formed through irradiation of the particles. {CF} {MALDI} and aerosol {MALDI} have both been coupled to {LC} separations, although further refinements in both techniques are needed. Future prospects for liquid separations and both off-line and on-line {MALDI} are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc., Mass Spectrom Rev 16, 283{\textendash}299, 1997},

	abstract = {The hypothesis that direct determination of electrospray current would provide a viable method for maintaining spray stability to enable optimal nanospray analysis was tested by building a feedback apparatus capable of reading the current and readjusting the emitter voltage in real time. The apparatus consists of a current-sensing circuit that reads the voltage drop across a resistor located between the high-voltage power supply and the nanospray emitter. A low voltage proportional to the observed current is generated and sent to a data acquisition card. The information is used by a proportional-derivative-integral ({PID}) algorithm to calculate the magnitude of a low-voltage signal that is used to control the power supply output. Any variation of current across the sensing resistor is thus counteracted by an opposite-direction variation of the high voltage applied to the nanospray emitter. In this way, the apparatus adjusts the emitter voltage to achieve a preset value of current, which it strives to maintain over time in spite of any possible variation of the parameters influencing the spray regime. Preliminary results have shown that the feedback apparatus is capable of establishing and maintaining stable spray for samples that are usually considered challenging in traditional voltage-controlled analysis, such as those consisting of nucleic acid solutions with high salt loads. For these types of samples, the total ion count recorded in current-controlled mode was significantly more stable than that observed in voltage-controlled mode. At the same time, overall signal intensities and signal-to-noise ratios were also significantly improved. Setting the target nanospray current to a predefined value and letting the apparatus reach the target without operator intervention enabled the acquisition of viable data from solutions containing up to 2.5 M ammonium acetate, which are ordinarily difficult by traditional manual tuning. A deeper understanding of the current{\textendash}voltage relationships for samples of very different compositions is expected to enable one not only to predict the target current that should be used for a certain analysis, but also to devise algorithms to change such target as a function of predictable variations of sample properties and analytical conditions. This will allow for optimal performance to be maintained during on-line gradient chromatography in which the nature of the sprayed solution may vary very widely during the course of the analysis.},

Although protein sequences can be deduced from nucleotide sequences, posttranslational modifications to proteins, in general, cannot. We describe a process for the analysis of posttranslational modifications that is simple, robust, general, and can be applied to complicated protein mixtures. A protein or protein mixture is digested by using three different enzymes: one that cleaves in a site-specific manner and two others that cleave nonspecifically. The mixture of peptides is separated by multidimensional liquid chromatography and analyzed by a tandem mass spectrometer. This approach has been applied to modification analyses of proteins in a simple protein mixture, Cdc2p protein complexes isolated through the use of an affinity tag, and lens tissue from a patient with congenital cataracts. Phosphorylation sites have been detected with known stoichiometry of as low as 10\%. Eighteen sites of four different types of modification have been detected on three of the five proteins in a simple mixture, three of which were previously unreported. Three proteins from Cdc2p isolated complexes yielded eight sites containing three different types of modifications. In the lens tissue, 270 proteins were identified, and 11 different crystallins were found to contain a total of 73 sites of modification. Modifications identified in the crystallin proteins included Ser, Thr, and Tyr phosphorylation, Arg and Lys methylation, Lys acetylation, and Met, Tyr, and Trp oxidations. The method presented will be useful in discovering co- and posttranslational modifications of proteins.},

There has been much recent work on adapting data mining algorithms to time series databases. For example, Das et al. attempt to show how association rules can be learned from time series [7]. Debregeas and Hebrail [8] demonstrate a technique for scaling up time series clustering algorithms to massive datasets. Keogh and Pazzani introduced a new, scalable time series classification algorithm [16]. Almost all algorithms that operate on time series data need to compute the similarity between them. Euclidean distance, or some extension or modification thereof, is typically used. However as we will demonstrate in Section 2.1, Euclidean distance can be an extremely brittle distance measure.},

We argue that evaluating the error rates of peptide identifications is not unlike computing generating functions in combinatorics. We show that the generating functions and their derivatives (spectral energy and spectral probability) represent new features of tandem mass spectra that, similarly to ?-scores, significantly improve peptide identifications. Furthermore, the spectral probability provides a rigorous solution to the problem of computing statistical significance of spectral identifications. The spectral energy/probability approach improves the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff of existing {MS}/{MS} search tools, addresses the notoriously difficult problem of ?one-hit-wonders? in mass spectrometry, and often eliminates the need for decoy database searches. We therefore argue that the generating function approach has the potential to increase the number of peptide identifications in {MS}/{MS} searches.},

Data-dependent acquisition is used to automatically acquire tandem mass spectra of peptides eluting into the mass spectrometer. In more complicated mixtures, for example, whole cell lysates, data-dependent acquisition incompletely samples among the peptide ions present rather than acquiring tandem mass spectra for all ions available. We analyzed the sampling process and developed a statistical model to accurately predict the level of sampling expected for mixtures of a specific complexity. The model also predicts how many analyses are required for saturated sampling of a complex protein mixture. For a yeast-soluble cell lysate 10 analyses are required to reach a 95\% saturation level on protein identifications based on our model. The statistical model also suggests a relationship between the level of sampling observed for a protein and the relative abundance of the protein in the mixture. We demonstrate a linear dynamic range over 2 orders of magnitude by using the number of spectra (spectral sampling) acquired for each protein.},

Examples of such maps include libraries of the spectroscopic properties of molecules, or databases of drug structures in analytical or forensic chemistry. Such maps, and methods to navigate them, constitute reliable assays to probe any sample for the presence and amount of molecules contained in the map. So far, attempts to generate such maps for any proteome have failed to reach complete proteome coverage. Here we use a strategy based on high-throughput peptide synthesis and mass spectrometry to generate an almost complete reference map (97\% of the genome-predicted proteins) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. We generated two versions of this mass-spectrometric map, one supporting discovery-driven (shotgun) and the other supporting hypothesis-driven (targeted) proteomic measurements. Together, the two versions of the map constitute a complete set of proteomic assays to support most studies performed with contemporary proteomic technologies. To show the utility of the maps, we applied them to a protein quantitative trait locus ({QTL}) analysis, which requires precise measurement of the same set of peptides over a large number of samples. Protein measurements over 78 S. cerevisiae strains revealed a complex relationship between independent genetic loci, influencing the levels of related proteins. Our results suggest that selective pressure favours the acquisition of sets of polymorphisms that adapt protein levels but also maintain the stoichiometry of functionally related pathway members.},

Importantly, the sum of quantified proteins by {iBAQ} and {emPAI} corresponded with the Lowry total protein quantification, demonstrating applicability of label-free methods for an accurate calculation of protein concentrations at the proteome level. The {iBAQ} method showed the best correlation between biological replicates, a normal distribution among all protein abundances, and the lowest variation among ribosomal protein abundances, which are expected to have equal amounts.

Absolute quantitative proteome data enabled us to evaluate metabolic cost for protein synthesis and apparent catalytic activities of enzymes by integration with flux analysis. All the methods demonstrated similar {ATP} costs for protein synthesis for different cellular processes and that costs for expressing biomass synthesis related proteins were higher than those for energy generation. Importantly, catalytic activities of energy metabolism enzymes were an order or two higher than those of monomer synthesis.

	abstract = {{MALDI} imaging mass spectrometry ({MALDI}-{IMS}) has become a powerful tool for localizing both small molecules and intact proteins in a wide variety of tissue samples in both normal and diseased states. Identification of imaged signals in {MALDI}-{IMS} remains a bottleneck in the analysis and limits the interpretation of underlying biology of tissue specimens. In this work, spatially directed tissue microextraction of intact proteins followed by {LC}-{MS}/{MS} with electron transfer dissociation ({ETD}) was used to identify proteins from specific locations in three tissue types; ocular lens, brain, and kidney. Detection limits were such that a 1 ?L extraction volume was sufficient to deliver proteins to the {LC}-{MS}/{MS} instrumentation with sufficient sensitivity to detect 50?100 proteins in a single experiment. Additionally, multiple modified proteins were identified; including truncated lens proteins that would be difficult to assign to an imaged mass using a bottom-up approach. Protein separation and identification are expected to improve with advances in intact protein fractionation/chromatography and advances in interpretation algorithms leading to increased depth of proteome coverage from distinct tissue locations.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Proteomics has particularly evolved to become of high interest for the field of biomarker discovery and drug development. Especially the combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry ({LC}/{MS}) has proven to be a powerful technique for analyzing protein mixtures. Clinically orientated proteomic studies will have to compare hundreds of {LC}/{MS} runs at a time. In order to compare different runs, sophisticated preprocessing steps have to be performed. An important step is the retention time (rt) alignment of {LC}/{MS} runs. Especially non-linear shifts in the rt between pairs of {LC}/{MS} runs make this a crucial and non-trivial problem.Results: For the purpose of demonstrating the particular importance of correcting non-linear rt shifts, we evaluate and compare different alignment algorithms. We present and analyze two versions of a new algorithm that is based on regression techniques, once assuming and estimating only linear shifts and once also allowing for the estimation of non-linear shifts. As an example for another type of alignment method we use an established alignment algorithm based on shifting vectors that we adapted to allow for correcting non-linear shifts also. In a simulation study, we show that rt alignment procedures that can estimate non-linear shifts yield clearly better alignments. This is even true under mild non-linear deviations.Availability: R code for the regression-based alignment methods and simulated datasets are available at http://www.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/genetik-publikationen-alignment.{htmlContact}: katharina.podwojski@tu-dortmund.{deSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Concurrent peptide fragmentation data acquisition has been shown to be advantageous over data-dependent acquisition by providing greater detection dynamic range and providing more accurate quantitative information. Nevertheless, concurrent peptide fragmentation data acquisition remains to be widely adopted due to the lack of published algorithms designed specifically to process or interpret such data acquired on any mass spectrometer.
