% PIR - Peptide Intensity Redistribution

# Aim of algorithm
As given by `Protein Inference` problem
Identified proteins share peptides,

# Shared Peptides Signal Intensity Redistribution Algorithm

## Input data

Identified ion signals annotated by peptide sequences and related to proteins, 
as a table
	- set identifier
		- signal identifier
		- peptide identifier
		- protein identifier
		- run identifier
	- whole signal intensity

## Output

Portion of signal intensity for every petide in protein in run
	- set identifier
	- redistribution portion
	
## Steps

a) determine a set of avialable `Sharing Grades` (G) over all peptides,
	e.g. G = (1,2,3,4,7,9), with
	- G[n]<G[n+1]: elements in G are sorted in increasing order
	- G=1: unique peptides (proteospecific and razor peptides),
	- G>1: peptides shared by G proteins
b) redistributed intensity for peptides with G=1 equals to their whole signal intensity
b) for every G>1 as N do
	#. extract reference intensity for all proteins by peptides with N=1, e.g. Top3
