# peptide filtering

1. get peptides filtered by (write `peptides_passing_filter`):
	1. peptide in project replication rate
	2. peptide in project max identification score
	3. peptide identification score
	4. peptide identification type
	5. peptide sequence length	
2. map filtered peptides to emrts (write `emrts_annotated_by_filtered_peptides`)

# peptide-to-protein relation

1. map filtered peptides' sequences to protein ids (write `peptides_in_proteins`)
2. clone `peptides_in_proteins` (write `peptides_in_proteins_temp`)
3. recount source proteins for each peptide sequence (update `peptides_in_proteins`)
4. backup `peptides_in_proteins` (write `peptides_in_proteins_before_homology_filtering`)

# use only unique peptides
This step can be executed as an alternative to Homology Filtering

1. remove non-unique peptide sequences 
	that are peptides originally mapped to more than one protein before filtering
	(update `peptides_in_proteins_temp`)
2. remove non-unique sequences
	(update `peptides_in_proteins_temp`)
